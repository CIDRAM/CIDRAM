# If you want CIDRAM to completely ignore some specific sections within any of the signature files, you can use the
# "ignore.dat" file to specify which sections to ignore. On a new line, write "Ignore", followed by a space, followed
# by the name of the section that you want CIDRAM to ignore (anything else in this file won't have any effect on
# CIDRAM and can be treated in the same manner as comments, documentation markup, etc).

# The entries below correspond to signature sections considered to pose a high false positive risk, and also serve as
# an example of how to list entries in this file. If you feel that you don't need them (e.g., if they relate to a
# demographic/region that doesn't need to be served from your website), you should comment them out or remove them from
# this file entirely, to maximise the benefit that CIDRAM can provide. Alternatively, you could also enable CIDRAM's
# reCAPTCHA feature, which would require that users connecting from IP addresses associated with these signature
# sections complete a reCAPTCHA instance in order to be granted access to your website.
