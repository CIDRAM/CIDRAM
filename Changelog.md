## CIDRAM (Classless Inter-Domain Routing Access Manager) Changelog.

*CIDRAM adopts and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).*

### v3.0.0

#### *Other notes*
- *CIDRAM v3 branches from v2 at v2.8.0 (2022.02.14).*
- *At the time of branching, CIDRAM's changelog was more than 2,300 lines long and was becoming difficult to read due to both its length and its format. To improve readability, I've decided to clear out the old changelogs from the v3 branch, and to switch from plain-text format to markdown format from v3 onward. The old changelogs will continue at previous branches and remain accessible from there.*
