###1. <a name="SECTION1"></a>PREAMBLE

CIDRAM (Classless Inter-Domain Routing Access Manager) is a PHP script designed to protect websites by blocking requests originating from IP addresses regarded as being sources of undesirable traffic, including (but not limited to) traffic from non-human access endpoints, cloud services, spambots, scrapers, etc. It does this by calculating the possible CIDRs of the IP addresses supplied from inbound requests and then attempting to match these possible CIDRs against its signature files (these signature files contain lists of CIDRs of IP addresses regarded as being sources of undesirable traffic); If matches are found, the requests are blocked.

###2. <a name="SECTION2"></a>HOW TO INSTALL

I hope to streamline this process by making an installer at some point in the not too distant future, but until then, follow these instructions to get CIDRAM working on *most systems and CMS:

1) By your reading this, I'm assuming you've already downloaded an archived copy of the script, decompressed its contents and have it sitting somewhere on your local machine. From here, you'll want to work out where on your host or CMS you want to place those contents. A directory such as `/public_html/cidram/` or similar (though, it doesn't matter which you choose, so long as it's something secure and something you're happy with) will suffice. *Before you begin uploading, read on..*

2) Rename `config.ini.RenameMe` to `config.ini` (located inside `vault`), and optionally (strongly recommended for advanced users, but not recommended for beginners or for the inexperienced), open it (this file contains all the directives available for CIDRAM; above each option should be a brief comment describing what it does and what it's for). Adjust these directives as you see fit, as per whatever is appropriate for your particular setup. Save file, close.

3) Upload the contents (CIDRAM and its files) to the directory you'd decided on earlier (you don't need to include the `*.txt`/`*.md` files, but mostly, you should upload everything).

4) CHMOD the `vault` directory to "755" (if there are problems, you can try "777"; this is less secure, though). The main directory storing the contents (the one you chose earlier), usually, can be left alone, but CHMOD status should be checked if you've had permissions issues in the past on your system (by default, should be something like "755").

5) Next, you'll need to "hook" CIDRAM to your system or CMS. There are several different ways you can "hook" scripts such as CIDRAM to your system or CMS, but the easiest is to simply include the script at the beginning of a core file of your system or CMS (one that'll generally always be loaded when someone accesses any page across your website) using a `require` or `include` statement. Usually, this'll be something stored in a directory such as `/includes`, `/assets` or `/functions`, and will often be named something like `init.php`, `common_functions.php`, `functions.php` or similar. You'll have to work out which file this is for your situation; If you encounter difficulties in working this out for yourself, visit the CIDRAM issues page on Github. To do this [to use `require` or `include`], insert the following line of code to the very beginning of that core file, replacing the string contained inside the quotation marks with the exact address of the `loader.php` file (local address, not the HTTP address; it'll look similar to the vault address mentioned earlier).

`<?php require '/user_name/public_html/cidram/loader.php'; ?>`

Save file, close, reupload.

-- OR ALTERNATIVELY --

If you're using an Apache webserver and if you have access to `php.ini`, you can use the `auto_prepend_file` directive to prepend CIDRAM whenever any PHP request is made. Something like:

`auto_prepend_file = "/user_name/public_html/cidram/loader.php"`

Or this in the `.htaccess` file:

`php_value auto_prepend_file "/user_name/public_html/cidram/loader.php"`

6) That's everything! :-)

---


###3. <a name="SECTION3"></a>HOW TO USE

CIDRAM should automatically block undesirable requests to your website without requiring any manual assistance, aside from its initial installation.

Updating is done manually, and you can customise your configuration and customise which CIDRs are blocked by modifying your configuration file and/or your signature files.

If you encounter any false positives, please contact me to let me know about it.

###5. <a name="SECTION5"></a>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
The following is a list of the directives available to CIDRAM in the `config.ini` configuration file, along with a description of the purpose of these directives.

####"general" (Category)
General CIDRAM configuration.

"logfile"
- Human readable file for logging all blocked access attempts. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable.

"logfileApache"
- Apache-style file for logging all blocked access attempts. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable.

"logfileSerialized"
- Serialised file for logging all blocked access attempts. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable.

*Useful tip: If you want, you can append date/time information to the names of your logfiles by including these in the name: `{yyyy}` for complete year, `{yy}` for abbreviated year, `{mm}` for month, `{dd}` for day, `{hh}` for hour.*

*Examples:*
- *`logfile='logfile.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{hh}.txt'`*
- *`logfileApache='access.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{hh}.txt'`*
- *`logfileSerialized='serial.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{hh}.txt'`*

"timeOffset"
- If your server time doesn't match your local time, you can specify an offset here to adjust the date/time information generated by CIDRAM according to your needs. It's generally recommended instead to adjust the timezone directive in your `php.ini` file, but sometimes (such as when working with limited shared hosting providers) this isn't always possible to do, and so, this option is provided here. Offset is in minutes.
- Example (to add one hour): `timeOffset=60`

"ipaddr"
- Where to find the IP address of connecting requests? (Useful for services such as Cloudflare and the likes) Default = REMOTE_ADDR. WARNING: Don't change this unless you know what you're doing!

"forbid_on_block"
- Which headers should CIDRAM respond with when blocking requests? False/200 = 200 OK [Default]; True = 403 Forbidden; 503 = 503 Service unavailable.

"silent_mode"
- Should CIDRAM silently redirect blocked access attempts instead of displaying the "Access Denied" page? If yes, specify the location to redirect blocked access attempts to. If no, leave this variable blank.

"lang"
- Specify the default language for CIDRAM.

"emailaddr"
- If you wish, you can supply an email address here to be given to users when they're blocked, for them to use as a point of contact for support and/or assistance for in the event of them being blocked mistakenly or in error. WARNING: Whatever email address you supply here will most certainly be acquired by spambots and scrapers during the course of its being used here, and so, it's strongly recommended that if you choose to supply an email address here, that you ensure that the email address you supply here is a disposable address and/or an address that you don't mind being spammed (in other words, you probably don't want to use your primary personal or primary business email addresses).

"disable_cli"
- Disable CLI mode? CLI mode is enabled by default, but can sometimes interfere with certain testing tools (such as PHPUnit, for example) and other CLI-based applications. If you don't need to disable CLI mode, you should ignore this directive. False = Enable CLI mode [Default]; True = Disable CLI mode.

"disable_frontend"
- Disable front-end access? Front-end access can make CIDRAM more manageable, but can also be a potential security risk, too. It's recommended to manage CIDRAM via the back-end whenever possible, but front-end access is provided for when it isn't possible. Keep it disabled unless you need it. False = Enable front-end access; True = Disable front-end access [Default].

####"signatures" (Category)
Signatures configuration.

"ipv4"
- A list of the IPv4 signature files that CIDRAM should attempt to parse, delimited by commas. You can add entries here if you want to include additional IPv4 signature files into CIDRAM.

"ipv6"
- A list of the IPv6 signature files that CIDRAM should attempt to parse, delimited by commas. You can add entries here if you want to include additional IPv6 signature files into CIDRAM.

"block_cloud"
- Block CIDRs identified as belonging to webhosting/cloud services? If you operate an API service from your website or if you expect other websites to connect to your website, this should be set to false. If you don't, then, this directive should be set to true.

"block_bogons"
- Block bogon/martian CIDRs? If you expect connections to your website from within your local network, from localhost, or from your LAN, this directive should be set to false. If you don't expect these such connections, this directive should be set to true.

"block_generic"
- Block CIDRs generally recommended for blacklisting? This covers any signatures that aren't marked as being part of any of the other more specific signature categories.

"block_proxies"
- Block CIDRs identified as belonging to proxy services? If you require that users be able to access your website from anonymous proxy services, this should be set to false. Otherwise, if you don't require anonymous proxies, this directive should be set to true as a means of improving security.

"block_spam"
- Block CIDRs identified as being high-risk for spam? Unless you experience problems when doing so, generally, this should always be set to true.

####"recaptcha" (Category)
Optionally, you can provide users with a way to bypass the "Access Denied" page by way of completing a reCAPTCHA instance, if you want to do so. This can help to mitigate some of the risks associated with false positives in those situations where we're not entirely sure whether a request has originated from a machine or a human.

Due to the risks associated with providing a way for end-users to bypass the "Access Denied" page, generally, I would advise against enabling this feature unless you feel it to be necessary to do so. Situations where it could be necessary: If your website has customers/users that need to have access to your website, and if this is something that can't be compromised on, but if those customers/users happen to be connecting from a hostile network that could potentially also be carrying undesirable traffic, and blocking this undesirable traffic is also something that can't be compromised on, in those particular no-win situations, the reCAPTCHA feature could come in handy as a means of allowing the desirable customers/users, while keeping out the undesirable traffic from the same network. That said though, given that the intended purpose of a CAPTCHA is to distinguish between humans and non-humans, the reCAPTCHA feature would only assist in these no-win situations if we're to assume that this undesirable traffic is non-human (eg, spambots, scrapers, hacktools, automated traffic), as opposed to being undesirable human traffic (such as human spammers, hackers, et al).

To obtain a "site key" and a "secret key" (required for using reCAPTCHA), please go to: [https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/)

"usemode"
- Defines how CIDRAM should use reCAPTCHA.
- 0 = reCAPTCHA is completely disabled (default).
- 1 = reCAPTCHA is enabled for all signatures.
- 2 = reCAPTCHA is enabled only for signatures belonging to sections specially marked as reCAPTCHA-enabled within the signature files.
- (Any other value will be treated in the same way as 0).

"lockip"
- Specifies whether hashes should be locked to specific IPs. False = Cookies and hashes CAN be used across multiple IPs (default). True = Cookies and hashes CAN'T be used across multiple IPs (cookies/hashes are locked to IPs).
- Note: "lockip" value is ignored when "lockuser" is false, due to that the mechanism for remembering "users" differs depending on this value.

"lockuser"
- Specifies whether successful completion of a reCAPTCHA instance should be locked to specific users. False = Successful completion of a reCAPTCHA instance will grant access to all requests originating from the same IP as that used by the user completing the reCAPTCHA instance; Cookies and hashes aren't used; Instead, an IP whitelist will be used. True = Successful completion of a reCAPTCHA instance will only grant access to the user completing the reCAPTCHA instance; Cookies and hashes are used to remember the user; An IP whitelist is not used (default).

"sitekey"
- This value should correspond to the "site key" for your reCAPTCHA, which can be found within the reCAPTCHA dashboard.

"secret"
- This value should correspond to the "secret key" for your reCAPTCHA, which can be found within the reCAPTCHA dashboard.

"expiry"
- When "lockuser" is true (default), in order to remember when a user has successfully passed a reCAPTCHA instance, for future page requests, CIDRAM generates a standard HTTP cookie containing a hash which corresponds to an internal record containing that same hash; Future page requests will use these corresponding hashes to authenticate that a user has previously already passed a reCAPTCHA instance. When "lockuser" is false, an IP whitelist is used to determine whether requests should be permitted from the IP of inbound requests; Entries are added to this whitelist when the reCAPTCHA instance is successfully passed. For how many hours should these cookies, hashes and whitelist entries remain valid? Default = 720 (1 month).

"logfile"
- Log all reCAPTCHA attempts? If yes, specify the name to use for the logfile. If no, leave this variable blank.

*Useful tip: If you want, you can append date/time information to the names of your logfiles by including these in the name: `{yyyy}` for complete year, `{yy}` for abbreviated year, `{mm}` for month, `{dd}` for day, `{hh}` for hour.*

*Examples:*
- *`logfile='recaptcha.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{hh}.txt'`*

####"template_data" (Category)
Directives/Variables for templates and themes.

Relates to the HTML output used to generate the "Access Denied" page. If you're using custom themes for CIDRAM, HTML output is sourced from the `template_custom.html` file, and otherwise, HTML output is sourced from the `template.html` file. Variables written to this section of the configuration file are parsed to the HTML output by way of replacing any variable names circumfixed by curly brackets found within the HTML output with the corresponding variable data. For example, where `foo="bar"`, any instance of `<p>{foo}</p>` found within the HTML output will become `<p>bar</p>`.

"css_url"
- The template file for custom themes utilises external CSS properties, whereas the template file for the default theme utilises internal CSS properties. To instruct CIDRAM to use the template file for custom themes, specify the public HTTP address of your custom theme's CSS files using the `css_url` variable. If you leave this variable blank, CIDRAM will use the template file for the default theme.

###6. <a name="SECTION6"></a>SIGNATURE FORMAT

####6.0 BASICS

A description of the format and structure of the signatures used by CIDRAM can be found documented in plain-text within either of the two custom signature files. Please refer to that documentation to learn more about the format and structure of the signatures of CIDRAM.

All IPv4 signatures follow the format: `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/yy [Function] [Param]`.
- `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` represents the beginning of the CIDR block (the octets of the initial IP address in the block).
- `yy` represents the CIDR block size [1-32].
- `[Function]` instructs the script what to do with the signature (how the signature should be regarded).
- `[Param]` represents whatever additional information may be required by `[Function]`.

All IPv6 signatures follow the format: `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::xxxx/yy [Function] [Param]`.
- `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::xxxx` represents the beginning of the CIDR block (the octets of the initial IP address in the block). Complete notation and abbreviated notation are both acceptable (and each MUST follow the appropriate and relevant standards of IPv6 notation, but with one exception: an IPv6 address can never begin with an abbreviation when used in a signature for this script, due to the way in which CIDRs are reconstructed by the script; For example, `::1/128` should be expressed, when used in a signature, as `0::1/128`, and `::0/128` expressed as `0::/128`).
- `yy` represents the CIDR block size [1-128].
- `[Function]` instructs the script what to do with the signature (how the signature should be regarded).
- `[Param]` represents whatever additional information may be required by `[Function]`.

The signature files for CIDRAM SHOULD use Unix-style linebreaks (`%0A`, or `\n`)! Other types/styles of linebreaks (eg, Windows `%0D%0A` or `\r\n` linebreaks, Mac `%0D` or `\r` linebreaks, etc) MAY be used, but are NOT preferred. Non-Unix-style linebreaks will be normalised to Unix-style linebreaks by the script.

Precise and correct CIDR notation is required, otherwise the script will NOT recognise the signatures. Additionally, all the CIDR signatures of this script MUST begin with an IP address whose IP number can divide evenly into the block division represented by its CIDR block size (eg, if you wanted to block all IPs from `10.128.0.0` to `11.127.255.255`, `10.128.0.0/8` would NOT be recognised by the script, but `10.128.0.0/9` and `11.0.0.0/9` used in conjunction, WOULD be recognised by the script).

Anything in the signature files not recognised as a signature nor as signature-related syntax by the script will be IGNORED, therefore meaning that you can safely put any non-signature data that you want into the signature files without breaking them and without breaking the script. Comments are acceptable in the signature files, and no special formatting is required for them. Shell-style hashing for comments is preferred, but not enforced; Functionally, it makes no difference to the script whether or not you choose to use Shell-style hashing for comments, but using Shell-style hashing helps IDEs and plain-text editors to correctly highlight the various parts of the signature files (and so, Shell-style hashing can assist as a visual aid while editing).

The possible values of `[Function]` are as follows:
- Run
- Whitelist
- Greylist
- Deny

If "Run" is used, when the signature is triggered, the script will attempt to execute (using a `require_once` statement) an external PHP script, specified by the `[Param]` value (the working directory should be the "/vault/" directory of the script).

Example: `127.0.0.0/8 Run example.php`

This can be useful if you want to execute some specific PHP code for some specific IPs and/or CIDRs.

If "Whitelist" is used, when the signature is triggered, the script will reset all detections (if there's been any detections) and break the test function. `[Param]` is ignored. This function is the equivalent of whitelisting a particular IP or CIDR from being detected.

Example: `127.0.0.1/32 Whitelist`

If "Greylist" is used, when the signature is triggered, the script will reset all detections (if there's been any detections) and skip to the next signature file to continue processing. `[Param]` is ignored.

Example: `127.0.0.1/32 Greylist`

If "Deny" is used, when the signature is triggered, assuming no whitelist signature has been triggered for the given IP address and/or given CIDR, access to the protected page will be denied. "Deny" is what you'll want to use to actually block an IP address and/or CIDR range. When any signatures are triggered that make use of "Deny", the "Access Denied" page of the script will be generated and the request to the protected page killed.

The `[Param]` value accepted by "Deny" will be parsed to the "Access Denied" page output, supplied to the client/user as the cited reason for their access to the requested page being denied. It can be either a short and simple sentence, explaining why you've chosen to block them (anything should suffice, even a simple "I don't want you on my website"), or one of a small handful of shorthand words supplied by the script, that if used, will be replaced by the script with a pre-prepared explanation of why the client/user has been blocked.

The pre-prepared explanations have i18n support and can be translated by the script based upon the language you specify to the `lang` directive of the script configuration. Additionally, you can instruct the script to ignore "Deny" signatures based upon their `[Param]` value (if they're using these shorthand words) via the directives specified by the script configuration (each shorthand word has a corresponding directive to either process the corresponding signatures or to ignore them). `[Param]` values that don't use these shorthand words, however, don't have i18n support and therefore WON'T be translated by the script, and additionally, aren't directly controllable by the script configuration.

The available shorthand words are:
- Bogon
- Cloud
- Generic
- Proxy
- Spam

####6.1 TAGS

If you want to split your custom signatures into individual sections, you can identify these individual sections to the script by adding a "section tag" immediately after the signatures of each section, along with the name of your signature section (see the example below).

```
# "Section 1."
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Bogon
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Cloud
4.5.6.7/32 Deny Generic
5.6.7.8/32 Deny Spam
6.7.8.9/32 Deny Proxy
Tag: Section 1
```

To break section tagging and to ensure that tags aren't incorrectly identified to signature sections from earlier in the signature files, simply ensure that there are at least two consecutive linebreaks between your tag and your earlier signature sections. Any untagged signatures will default to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" (depending on which types of signatures are being triggered).

```
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Bogon
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Cloud

4.5.6.7/32 Deny Generic
5.6.7.8/32 Deny Spam
Tag: Section 1
```

In the above example `1.2.3.4/32` and `2.3.4.5/32` will be tagged as "IPv4", whereas `4.5.6.7/32` and `5.6.7.8/32` will be tagged as "Section 1".

If you want signatures to expire after some time, in a similar manner to section tags, you can use an "expiry tag" to specify when signatures should cease to be valid. Expiry tags use the format "YYYY.MM.DD" (see the example below).

```
# "Section 1."
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Generic
Expires: 2016.12.31
```

Section tags and expiry tags may be used in conjunction, and both are optional (see the example below).

```
# "Example Section."
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic
Tag: Example Section
Expires: 2016.12.31
```

####6.2 YAML

#####6.2.0 YAML BASICS

A simplified form of YAML markup may be used in signature files for the purpose of defining behaviours and settings specific to individual signature sections. This may be useful if you want the value of your configuration directives to differ on the basis of individual signatures and signature sections (for example; if you want to supply an email address for support tickets for any users blocked by one particular signature, but don't want to supply an email address for support tickets for users blocked by any other signatures; if you want some specific signatures to trigger a page redirect; if you want to mark a signature section for use with reCAPTCHA; if you want to log blocked access attempts to separate files on the basis of individual signatures and/or signature sections).

Use of YAML markup in the signature files is entirely optional (ie, you may use it if you wish to do so, but you are not required to do so), and is able to leverage most (but not all) configuration directives.

Note: YAML markup implementation in CIDRAM is very simplistic and very limited; It is intended to fulfill requirements specific to CIDRAM in a manner that has the familiarity of YAML markup, but neither follows nor complies with official specifications (and therefore won't behave in the same way as more thorough implementations elsewhere, and may not be appropriate for other projects elsewhere).

In CIDRAM, YAML markup segments are identified to the script by three dashes ("---"), and terminate alongside their containing signature sections by double-linebreaks. A typical YAML markup segment within a signature section consists of three dashes on a line immediately after the list of CIDRS and any tags, followed by a two dimensional list of key-value pairs (first dimension, configuration directive categories; second dimension, configuration directives) for which configuration directives should be modified (and to which values) whenever a signature within that signature section is triggered (see the examples below).

```
# "Foobar 1."
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Generic
4.5.6.7/32 Deny Generic
Tag: Foobar 1

#####6.2.1 HOW TO "SPECIALLY MARK" SIGNATURE SECTIONS FOR USE WITH reCAPTCHA

When "usemode" is 0 or 1, signature sections don't need to be "specially marked" for use with reCAPTCHA (because they already either will or won't use reCAPTCHA, depending on this setting).

When "usemode" is 2, to "specially mark" signature sections for use with reCAPTCHA, an entry is included in the YAML segment for that signature section (see the example below).

```
# This section will use reCAPTCHA.
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Generic
Tag: reCAPTCHA-Enabled
---
recaptcha:
 enabled: true
```

Note: A reCAPTCHA instance will ONLY be offered to the user if reCAPTCHA is enabled (either with "usemode" as 1, or "usemode" as 2 with "enabled" as true), and if exactly ONE signature has been triggered (no more, no less; if multiple signatures are triggered, a reCAPTCHA instance will NOT be offered).

####6.3 AUXILIARY

In addition, if you want CIDRAM to completely ignore some specific sections within any of the signature files, you can use the `ignore.dat` file to specify which sections to ignore. On a new line, write `Ignore`, followed by a space, followed by the name of the section that you want CIDRAM to ignore (see the example below).

```
Ignore Section 1
```

Refer to the custom signature files for more information.

###7. <a name="SECTION7"></a>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

####What is a "false positive"?

The term "false positive" (*alternatively: "false positive error"; "false alarm"*), described very simply, and in a generalised context, is used when testing for a condition, to refer to the results of that test, when the results are positive (ie, the condition is determined to be "positive", or "true"), but are expected to be (or should have been) negative (ie, the condition, in reality, is "negative", or "false"). A "false positive" could be considered analogous to "crying wolf" (wherein the condition being tested is whether there's a wolf near the herd, the condition is "false" in that there's no wolf near the herd, and the condition is reported as "positive" by the shepherd by way of calling "wolf, wolf"), or analogous to situations in medical testing wherein a patient is diagnosed as having some illness or disease, when in reality, they have no such illness or disease.

Related outcomes when testing for a condition can be described using the terms "true positive", "true negative" and "false negative". A "true positive" refers to when the results of the test and the actual state of the condition are both true (or "positive"), and a "true negative" refers to when the results of the test and the actual state of the condition are both false (or "negative"); A "true positive" or a "true negative" is considered to be a "correct inference". The antithesis of a "false positive" is a "false negative"; A "false negative" refers to when the results of the test are negative (ie, the condition is determined to be "negative", or "false"), but are expected to be (or should have been) positive (ie, the condition, in reality, is "positive", or "true").

In the context of CIDRAM, these terms refer to the signatures of CIDRAM and what/whom they block. When CIDRAM blocks an IP address due to bad, outdated or incorrect signatures, but shouldn't have done so, or when it does so for the wrong reasons, we refer to this event as a "false positive". When CIDRAM fails to block an IP address that should have been blocked, due to unforeseen threats, missing signatures or shortfalls in its signatures, we refer to this event as a "missed detection" (which is analogous to a "false negative").

This can be summarised by the table below:

&nbsp; | CIDRAM should *NOT* block an IP address | CIDRAM *SHOULD* block an IP address
---|---|---
CIDRAM does *NOT* block an IP address | True negative (correct inference) | Missed detection (analogous to false negative)
CIDRAM *DOES* block an IP address | __False positive__ | True positive (correct inference)
