# Regarding translations: My native language is English. Because this is a free
# and open-source hobby project which generates zero income, and translatable
# content is likely to change as the features and functionality supported by
# the project changes, it doesn't make sense for me to spend money for
# translations. Because I'm the sole author/developer/maintainer for the
# project and I'm not a ployglot, any translations I produce are very likely to
# contain errors. Sorry, but realistically, that won't ever change. If you find
# any such errors/typos/mistakes/etc, your assistance to correct them would be
# very much appreciated. Pull requests are invited and encouraged. Otherwise,
# if you find these errors too much to handle, just stick with the original
# English source. If a translation is irredeemably incomprehensible, let me
# know which, and I can delete it. If you're not sure how to perform pull
# requests, ask. I can help.

WARNING: Whatever email address you supply here will most certainly be acquired by spambots and scrapers during the course of its being used here, and so, it's strongly recommended that if you choose to supply an email address here, that you ensure that the email address you supply here is a disposable address and/or an address that you don't mind being spammed (in other words, you probably don't want to use your primary personal or primary business email addresses)."

config_logging_log_sanitisation: "When using the front-end logs page to view log data, CIDRAM sanitises the log data before displaying it, to protect users from XSS attacks and other potential threats that log data could contain. However, by default, data isn't sanitised during logging. This is to ensure that log data is preserved accurately, to aid any heuristic or forensic analysis that might be necessary in the future. However, in the event that a user attempts to read log data using external tools, and if those external tools don't perform their own sanitisation process, the user could be exposed to XSS attacks. If necessary, you can change the default behaviour using this configuration directive. True = Sanitise data when logging it (data is preserved less accurately, but XSS risk is lower). False = Don't sanitise data when logging it (data is preserved more accurately, but XSS risk is higher) [Default]."

config_phpmailer_skip_auth_process: "Setting this directive to <code>true</code> instructs PHPMailer to skip the normal authentication process that normally occurs when sending email via SMTP. This should be avoided, because skipping this process may expose outbound email to MITM attacks, but may be necessary in cases where this process prevents PHPMailer from connecting to an SMTP server."

 0.: "If your website needs access via LAN or localhost, don't block this. Otherwise though, you can block this."

 2.: "If you need users to be able to access your website via proxies, don't block this. Otherwise though, you can block this."

 4.: "Refers to cases where shorthand words aren't used at all, or aren't recognised by CIDRAM."
 One per signature.: "A signature may invoke multiple profiles, but can use only one shorthand word. It's possible that multiple shorthand words may be suitable, but as only one can be used, we aim to always use only the most suitable."
 Priority.: "An option selected always takes priority over an option not selected. E.g., if multiple shorthand words are in play but only one of them is set as being blocked, the request will still be blocked."
 Human endpoints and cloud services.: "Cloud service may refer to webhosting providers, server farms, data centers, or any number of other things. Human endpoint refers to the means by which a human accesses the internet, such as by way of an internet service provider. A network usually provides just one or the other, but may sometimes provide both. We aim to never identify potential human endpoints as cloud services. Therefore, a cloud service may be identified as something else if its range is shared by known human endpoints. Conversely, we aim to always identify cloud services, whose ranges are not shared by any known human endpoints, as cloud services. Therefore, a request identified explicitly as a cloud service probably doesn't share its range with any known human endpoints. Likewise, a request identified explicitly by attacks or spam probably does. However, the internet is always in flux, the purposes of networks changes over time, and ranges are always being bought or sold, so remain cognisant and vigilant in regards to false positives."
hints_verification:
 "What are "positives" and "negatives"?": "When verifying the identity presented by a request, a successful outcome could be described as "positive" or "negative". In the case that the identity presented is confirmed to be the true identity, it would be described as "positive". In the case that the identity presented is confirmed to be falsified, it would be described as "negative". However, an unsuccessful outcome (e.g., verification fails, or the veracity of the identity presented isn't able to be determined) would not be described as "positive" or "negative". Instead, an unsuccessful outcome would be described simply as non-verified. When no attempt to verify the identity presented by a request is made, the request would be likewise be described as non-verified. The terms make sense only in the context where the identity presented by a request is recognised, and therefore, where verification is possible. In cases where the identity presented doesn't match the options provided above, or where no identity is presented, the options provided above become irrelevant."
 "What are "single-hit bypasses"?": "In some cases, a positive-verified request may still blocked as a result of the signature files, modules, or other conditions of the request, and bypasses may be necessary in order to avoid false positives. In the case where a bypass is intended to deal with exactly one infraction, no more and no less, such a bypass could be described as a "single-hit bypass"."
info_cli_by_default_ips: |
 By default, IPs are tested against all signature files, all modules, all
 auxiliary rules, *and* against social media and search engine verification.
 However, you can optionally disable, on a per-IP basis, checking against
 modules with --no-mod, checking against auxiliary rules with --no-aux, and
 checking against social media and search engine verification with --no-ssv,
 like so:
info_cli_cidram_cli_mod: "CIDRAM CLI mode."
info_cli_ipv4_ipv6_are_: |
 IPv4/IPv6 are both supported. Multiline input is possible for *all* CLI mode
 operations (e.g., to test multiple IP addresses in a single operation) by
 using quotes, like so:
info_cli_or_depending_o: "Or, depending on whether you'd prefer to chain first to last, or last to first:"
info_cli_or_to_aggregat: "Or, to aggregate them as netmasks:"
info_cli_or_using_comma: "Or, using commas instead of multilines (does exactly the same thing):"
info_cli_the_signature_: "The signature fixer can be used via CLI, too:"
info_cli_to_calculate_c: "To calculate CIDRs from an IP address:"
info_cli_to_test_whethe: "To test whether an IP address is blocked by CIDRAM:"
info_cli_to_quit_type_q: "To quit, type "q", "quit", or "exit", then press enter."
info_cli_you_can_also_a: "You can also aggregate IPs and CIDRs like so:"
info_cli_you_can_also_c: |
 You can also chain commands together (the example reads from some files,
 aggregates their content, then writes the aggregated data to output.dat):
info_cli_you_can_also_r: "You can also read from files like so:"
info_cli_you_can_also_u: |
 You can also use commas instead if you want (this is treated the same as using
 multilines, but you won't need to use quotes, and don't mix both together):
info_cli_you_can_also_w: "You can also write to files like so:"
info_cli_you_can_print_: |
 You can print data to the screen like so (sometimes useful when chaining
 commands):
