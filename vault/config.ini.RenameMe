[general]

; Log blocked access attempts to a human readable logfile? If yes, specify the
; name of the file to log results to. If no, leave this variable blank. It's
; recommended to enable this feature whenever possible to assist with debugging
; and monitoring. Example: logfile='logfile.txt'
; Useful tip: If you want, you can append date/time information to the name of
; your logfile by including these in the name: {yyyy} for complete year, {yy}
; for abbreviated year, {mm} for month, {dd} for day, {hh} for hour.
; Example: logfile='logfile.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.txt'
logfile=''

; Log blocked access attempts to an Apache-style logfile? If yes, specify the
; name of the file to log results to. If no, leave this variable blank. This
; feature can be useful if you want to integrate CIDRAM with packages such as
; fail2ban, which require Apache-style logfiles (but isn't generally required
; otherwise). Example: logfileApache='access.txt'
; Useful tip: If you want, you can append date/time information to the name of
; your logfile by including these in the name: {yyyy} for complete year, {yy}
; for abbreviated year, {mm} for month, {dd} for day, {hh} for hour.
; Example: logfileApache='access.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.txt'
logfileApache=''

; Log blocked access attempts to a serialised logfile? If yes, specify the name
; of the file to log results to. If no, leave this variable blank. This feature
; can be useful if you want to integrate CIDRAM with packages that work with
; serialised data (but isn't generally required otherwise).
; Example: logfileSerialized='serial.txt'
; Useful tip: If you want, you can append date/time information to the name of
; your logfile by including these in the name: {yyyy} for complete year, {yy}
; for abbreviated year, {mm} for month, {dd} for day, {hh} for hour.
; Example: logfileSerialized='serial.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.txt'
logfileSerialized=''

; If your server time doesn't match your local time, you can specify an offset
; here to adjust the date/time information generated by CIDRAM according to
; your needs. It's generally recommended instead to adjust the timezone
; directive in your "php.ini" file, but sometimes (such as when working with
; limited shared hosting providers) this isn't always possible to do, and so,
; this option is provided here. Offset is in minutes.
; Example (to add one hour): timeOffset=60
timeOffset=0

; Where to find IP address of connecting request? (Useful for services such as
; Cloudflare and the likes) Default = REMOTE_ADDR
; WARNING: Don't change this unless you know what you're doing!
ipaddr='REMOTE_ADDR'

; Which headers should CIDRAM respond with when blocking requests?
; False/200 = 200 OK [Default]; True = 403 Forbidden;
; 503 = 503 Service unavailable.
forbid_on_block=false

; Should CIDRAM silently redirect blocked access attempts instead of displaying
; the "Access Denied" page? If yes, specify the location to redirect blocked
; access attempts to. If no, leave this variable blank.
; Examples: silent_mode='http://127.0.0.1/' or silent_mode='http://google.com/'
silent_mode=''

; Specify the default language for CIDRAM. Available at this time:
; en - English;                 ar - Arabic;
; de - German;                  es - Spanish;
; fr - French;                  id - Indonesian;
; it - Italian;                 ja - Japanese;
; nl - Dutch;                   pt - Portuguese;
; ru - Russian;                 vi - Vietnamese;
; zh - Chinese (Simplified);    zh-TW - Chinese (Traditional).
lang='en'

; If you wish, you can supply an email address here to be given to users when
; they're blocked, for them to use as a point of contact for support and/or
; assistance for in the event of them being blocked mistakenly or in error.
; WARNING: Whatever email address you supply here will most certainly be
; acquired by spambots and scrapers during the course of its being used here,
; and so, it's strongly recommended that if you choose to supply an email
; address here, that you ensure that the email address you supply here is a
; disposable address and/or an address that you don't mind being spammed (in
; other words, you probably don't want to use your primary personal or primary
; business email addresses). Example: emailaddr='username@domain.tld'
emailaddr=''

; Disable CLI mode? CLI mode is enabled by default, but can sometimes interfere
; with certain testing tools (such as PHPUnit, for example) and other CLI-based
; applications. If you don't need to disable CLI mode, you should ignore this
; directive. False = Enable CLI mode [Default]; True = Disable CLI mode.
disable_cli=false

; Disable front-end access? Front-end access can make CIDRAM more manageable,
; but can also be a potential security risk, too. It's recommended to manage
; CIDRAM via the back-end whenever possible, but front-end access is provided
; for when it isn't possible. Keep it disabled unless you need it.
; False = Enable front-end access; True = Disable front-end access [Default].
disable_frontend=true



[signatures]

; A list of the IPv4 signature files that CIDRAM should attempt to parse,
; delimited by commas. You can add entries here if you want to include
; additional IPv4 signature files into CIDRAM.
ipv4='ipv4.dat,ipv4_custom.dat'

; A list of the IPv6 signature files that CIDRAM should attempt to parse,
; delimited by commas. You can add entries here if you want to include
; additional IPv4 signature files into CIDRAM.
ipv6='ipv6.dat,ipv6_custom.dat'

; Block CIDRs identified as belonging to webhosting/cloud services? If you
; operate an API service from your website or if you expect other websites to
; connect to your website, this should be set to false. If you don't, then,
; this directive should be set to true.
; False = No; True = Yes [Default].
block_cloud=true

; Block bogon/martian CIDRs? If you expect connections to your website from
; within your local network, from localhost, or from your LAN, this directive
; should be set to false. If you don't expect these such connections, this
; directive should be set to true. False = No [Default]; True = Yes.
block_bogons=false

; Block CIDRs generally recommended for blacklisting? This covers any
; signatures that aren't marked as being part of any of the other more specific
; signature categories. False = No; True = Yes [Default].
block_generic=true
; Block CIDRs identified as belonging to proxy services? If you require that
; users be able to access your website from anonymous proxy services, this
; should be set to false. Otherwise, if you don't require anonymous proxies,
; this directive should be set to true as a means of improving security.
; False = No [Default]; True = Yes.
block_proxies=false

; Block CIDRs identified as being high-risk for spam? Unless you experience
; problems when doing so, generally, this should always be set to true.
; False = No; True = Yes [Default].
block_spam=true



[recaptcha]

; Optionally, you can provide users with a way to bypass the "Access Denied"
; page by way of completing a reCAPTCHA instance, if you want to do so. This
; can help to mitigate some of the risks associated with false positives in
; those situations where we're not entirely sure whether a request has
; originated from a machine or a human.
; To obtain a "site key" and a "secret key" (required for using reCAPTCHA),
; please go to: https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/
; "usemode" defines how CIDRAM should use reCAPTCHA.
; 0 = reCAPTCHA is completely disabled (default).
; 1 = reCAPTCHA is enabled for all signatures.
; 2 = reCAPTCHA is enabled only for signatures belonging to sections specially
;     marked as reCAPTCHA-enabled within the signature files.
; (Any other value will be treated in the same way as 0).
usemode=0

; Specifies whether hashes should be locked to specific IPs. False = Cookies
; and hashes CAN be used across multiple IPs (default). True = Cookies and
; hashes CAN'T be used across multiple IPs (cookies/hashes are locked to IPs).
; Note: "lockip" value is ignored when "lockuser" is false, due to that the
; mechanism for remembering "users" differs depending on this value.
lockip=false

; Specifies whether successful completion of a reCAPTCHA instance should be
; locked to specific users. False = Successful completion of a reCAPTCHA
; instance will grant access to all requests originating from the same IP as
; that used by the user completing the reCAPTCHA instance; Cookies and hashes
; aren't used; Instead, an IP whitelist will be used. True = Successful
; completion of a reCAPTCHA instance will only grant access to the user
; completing the reCAPTCHA instance; Cookies and hashes are used to remember
; the user; An IP whitelist is not used (default).
lockuser=true

; This value should correspond to the "site key" for your reCAPTCHA, which can
; be found within the reCAPTCHA dashboard.
sitekey=''

; This value should correspond to the "secret key" for your reCAPTCHA, which
; can be found within the reCAPTCHA dashboard.
secret=''

; When "lockuser" is true (default), in order to remember when a user has
; successfully passed a reCAPTCHA instance, for future page requests, CIDRAM
; generates a standard HTTP cookie containing a hash which corresponds to an
; internal record containing that same hash; Future page requests will use
; these corresponding hashes to authenticate that a user has previously already
; passed a reCAPTCHA instance. When "lockuser" is false, an IP whitelist is
; used to determine whether requests should be permitted from the IP of inbound
; requests; Entries are added to this whitelist when the reCAPTCHA instance is
; successfully passed. For how many hours should these cookies, hashes and
; whitelist entries remain valid? Default = 720 (1 month).
expiry=720

; Log all reCAPTCHA attempts? If yes, specify the name to use for the logfile.
; If no, leave this variable blank. Example: logfile='recaptcha.txt'
; Useful tip: If you want, you can append date/time information to the name of
; your logfile by including these in the name: {yyyy} for complete year, {yy}
; for abbreviated year, {mm} for month, {dd} for day, {hh} for hour.
; Example: logfile='recaptcha.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.txt'
logfile=''



[template_data]

; Relates to the HTML output used to generate the "Access Denied" page. If
; you're using custom themes for CIDRAM, HTML output is sourced from the
; "template_custom.html" file, and otherwise, HTML output is sourced from the
; "template.html" file. Variables written to this section of the configuration
; file are parsed to the HTML output by way of replacing any variable names
; circumfixed by curly brackets found within the HTML output with the
; corresponding variable data. For example, where foo='bar', any instance of
; <p>{foo}</p> found within the HTML output will become <p>bar</p>.
; The template file for custom themes utilises external CSS properties, whereas
; the template file for the default theme utilises internal CSS properties. To
; instruct CIDRAM to use the template file for custom themes, specify the
; public HTTP address of your custom theme's CSS files using the "css_url"
; variable. If you leave this variable blank, CIDRAM will use the template file
; for the default theme.
css_url=''
