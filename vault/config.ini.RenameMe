; WARNING: Whatever email address you supply here will most certainly be
; acquired by spambots and scrapers during the course of its being used here,
; and so, it's strongly recommended that if you choose to supply an email
; address here, that you ensure that the email address you supply here is a

; Disable front-end access? Front-end access can make CIDRAM more manageable,
; but can also be a potential security risk, too. It's recommended to manage

; Attempt to verify requests from search engines? Verifying search engines
; ensures that they won't be banned as a result of exceeding the infraction
; limit (banning search engines from your website will usually have a negative
; effect upon your search engine ranking, SEO, etc). When verified, search
; engines can be blocked as per normal, but won't be banned. When not verified,
; it's possible for them to be banned as a result of exceeding the infraction
; limit. Additionally, search engine verification provides protection against
; fake search engine requests and against potentially malicious entities
; masquerading as search engines (such requests will be blocked when search
; engine verification is enabled). True = Enable search engine verification

; Force hostname lookups? True = Yes; False = No [Default]. Hostname lookups

; Block CIDRs in response to legal obligations? This directive shouldn't
; normally have any effect, because CIDRAM doesn't associate any CIDRs with

; Block CIDRs identified as belonging to proxy services or VPNs? If you require
; that users be able to access your website from proxy services and VPNs, this

; services or VPNs, this directive should be set to true as a means of
; improving security.
