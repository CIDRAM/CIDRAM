#
# Regarding translations: My native language is English. Because this is a free
# and open-source hobby project which generates zero income, and translatable
# content is likely to change as the features and functionality supported by
# the project changes, it doesn't make sense for me to spend money for
# translations. Because I'm the sole author/developer/maintainer for the
# project and I'm not a ployglot, any translations I produce are very likely to
# contain errors. Sorry, but realistically, that won't ever change. If you find
# any such errors/typos/mistakes/etc, your assistance to correct them would be
# very much appreciated. Pull requests are invited and encouraged. Otherwise,
# if you find these errors too much to handle, just stick with the original
# English source. If a translation is irredeemably incomprehensible, let me
# know which, and I can delete it. If you're not sure how to perform pull
# requests, ask. I can help.

False = Enable front-end access; True = Disable front-end access [Default]."
config_general_disable_webfonts: "Disable webfonts? True = Yes [Default]; False = No."

WARNING: Whatever email address you supply here will most certainly be acquired by spambots and scrapers during the course of its being used here, and so, it's strongly recommended that if you choose to supply an email address here, that you ensure that the email address you supply here is a disposable address and/or an address that you don't mind being spammed (in other words, you probably don't want to use your primary personal or primary business email addresses)."

When new logfiles are created, if the total number of logfiles exceeds the specified limit, the specified action will be performed. You can specify the desired limit here. A value of 0 will disable log rotation."
config_general_log_sanitisation: "When using the front-end logs page to view log data, CIDRAM sanitises the log data before displaying it, to protect users from XSS attacks and other potential threats that log data could contain. However, by default, data isn't sanitised during logging. This is to ensure that log data is preserved accurately, to aid any heuristic or forensic analysis that might be necessary in the future. However, in the event that a user attempts to read log data using external tools, and if those external tools don't perform their own sanitisation process, the user could be exposed to XSS attacks. If necessary, you can change the default behaviour using this configuration directive. True = Sanitise data when logging it (data is preserved less accurately, but XSS risk is lower). False = Don't sanitise data when logging it (data is preserved more accurately, but XSS risk is higher) [Default]."

config_general_protect_frontend: "Specifies whether the protections normally provided by CIDRAM should be applied to the front-end. True = Yes [Default]; False = No."
config_general_search_engine_verification: "Attempt to verify requests from search engines? Verifying search engines ensures that they won't be banned as a result of exceeding the infraction limit (banning search engines from your website will usually have a negative effect upon your search engine ranking, SEO, etc). When verified, search engines can be blocked as per normal, but won't be banned. When not verified, it's possible for them to be banned as a result of exceeding the infraction limit. Additionally, search engine verification provides protection against fake search engine requests and against potentially malicious entities masquerading as search engines (such requests will be blocked when search engine verification is enabled). True = Enable search engine verification [Default]; False = Disable search engine verification."
config_general_signatures_update_event_log: "A file for logging when signatures are updated via the front-end. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable."

config_general_truncate: "Truncate logfiles when they reach a certain size? Value is the maximum size in B/KB/MB/GB/TB that a logfile may grow to before being truncated. The default value of 0KB disables truncation (logfiles can grow indefinitely). Note: Applies to individual logfiles! The size of logfiles is not considered collectively."
