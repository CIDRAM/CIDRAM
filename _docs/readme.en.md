### 1. <a name="SECTION1"></a>PREAMBLE

CIDRAM (Classless Inter-Domain Routing Access Manager) is a PHP script designed to protect websites by blocking requests originating from IP addresses regarded as being sources of undesirable traffic, including (but not limited to) traffic from non-human access endpoints, cloud services, spambots, scrapers, etc. It does this by calculating the possible CIDRs of the IP addresses supplied from inbound requests and then attempting to match these possible CIDRs against its signature files (these signature files contain lists of CIDRs of IP addresses regarded as being sources of undesirable traffic); If matches are found, the requests are blocked.

### 2. <a name="SECTION2"></a>HOW TO INSTALL

#### 2.0 INSTALLING MANUALLY

1) By your reading this, I'm assuming you've already downloaded an archived copy of the script, decompressed its contents and have it sitting somewhere on your local machine. From here, you'll want to work out where on your host or CMS you want to place those contents. A directory such as `/public_html/cidram/` or similar (though, it doesn't matter which you choose, so long as it's something secure and something you're happy with) will suffice. *Before you begin uploading, read on..*

2) Rename `config.ini.RenameMe` to `config.ini` (located inside `vault`), and optionally (strongly recommended for advanced users, but not recommended for beginners or for the inexperienced), open it (this file contains all the directives available for CIDRAM; above each option should be a brief comment describing what it does and what it's for). Adjust these directives as you see fit, as per whatever is appropriate for your particular setup. Save file, close.

3) Upload the contents (CIDRAM and its files) to the directory you'd decided on earlier (you don't need to include the `*.txt`/`*.md` files, but mostly, you should upload everything).

4) CHMOD the `vault` directory to "755" (if there are problems, you can try "777"; this is less secure, though). The main directory storing the contents (the one you chose earlier), usually, can be left alone, but CHMOD status should be checked if you've had permissions issues in the past on your system (by default, should be something like "755").

5) Next, you'll need to "hook" CIDRAM to your system or CMS. There are several different ways you can "hook" scripts such as CIDRAM to your system or CMS, but the easiest is to simply include the script at the beginning of a core file of your system or CMS (one that'll generally always be loaded when someone accesses any page across your website) using a `require` or `include` statement. Usually, this'll be something stored in a directory such as `/includes`, `/assets` or `/functions`, and will often be named something like `init.php`, `common_functions.php`, `functions.php` or similar. You'll have to work out which file this is for your situation; If you encounter difficulties in working this out for yourself, visit the CIDRAM issues page on GitHub. To do this [to use `require` or `include`], insert the following line of code to the very beginning of that core file, replacing the string contained inside the quotation marks with the exact address of the `loader.php` file (local address, not the HTTP address; it'll look similar to the vault address mentioned earlier).

`<?php require '/user_name/public_html/cidram/loader.php'; ?>`

Save file, close, reupload.

-- OR ALTERNATIVELY --

If you're using an Apache webserver and if you have access to `php.ini`, you can use the `auto_prepend_file` directive to prepend CIDRAM whenever any PHP request is made. Something like:

`auto_prepend_file = "/user_name/public_html/cidram/loader.php"`

Or this in the `.htaccess` file:

`php_value auto_prepend_file "/user_name/public_html/cidram/loader.php"`

6) That's everything! :-)

#### 2.1 INSTALLING WITH COMPOSER

[CIDRAM is registered with Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/cidram/cidram), and so, if you're familiar with Composer, you can use Composer to install CIDRAM (you'll still need to prepare the configuration and hooks though; see "installing manually" steps 2 and 5).

`composer require cidram/cidram`

#### 2.2 INSTALLING FOR WORDPRESS

If you want to use CIDRAM with WordPress, you can ignore all the instructions above. [CIDRAM is registered as a plugin with the WordPress plugins database](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cidram/), and you can install CIDRAM directly from the plugins dashboard. You can install it in the same manner as any other plugin, and no addition steps are required. Just as with the other installation methods, you can customise your installation by modifying the contents of the `config.ini` file or by using the front-end configuration page. If you enable the CIDRAM front-end and update CIDRAM using the front-end updates page, this will automatically sync with the plugin version information displayed in the plugins dashboard.

*Warning: Updating CIDRAM via the plugins dashboard results in a clean installation! If you've customised your installation (changed your configuration, installed modules, etc), these customisations will be lost when updating via the plugins dashboard! Logfiles will also be lost when updating via the plugins dashboard! To preserve logfiles and customisations, update via the CIDRAM front-end updates page.*

---


### 3. <a name="SECTION3"></a>HOW TO USE

CIDRAM should automatically block undesirable requests to your website without requiring any manual assistance, aside from its initial installation.

You can customise your configuration and customise which CIDRs are blocked by modifying your configuration file and/or your signature files.

If you encounter any false positives, please contact me to let me know about it. *(See: [What is a "false positive"?](#WHAT_IS_A_FALSE_POSITIVE)).*

CIDRAM can be updated manually or via the front-end. CIDRAM can also be updated via Composer or WordPress, if originally installed via those means.

---


### 4. <a name="SECTION4"></a>FRONT-END MANAGEMENT

#### 4.0 WHAT IS THE FRONT-END.

The front-end provides a convenient and easy way to maintain, manage, and update your CIDRAM installation. You can view, share, and download logfiles via the logs page, you can modify configuration via the configuration page, you can install and uninstall components via the updates page, and you can upload, download, and modify files in your vault via the file manager.

The front-end is disabled by default in order to prevent unauthorised access (unauthorised access could have significant consequences for your website and its security). Instructions for enabling it are included below this paragraph.

#### 4.1 HOW TO ENABLE THE FRONT-END.

1) Locate the `disable_frontend` directive inside `config.ini`, and set it to `false` (it will be `true` by default).

2) Access `loader.php` from your browser (e.g., `http://localhost/cidram/loader.php`).

3) Log in with the default username and password (admin/password).

Note: After you've logged in for the first time, in order to prevent unauthorised access to the front-end, you should immediately change your username and password! This is very important, because it's possible to upload arbitrary PHP code to your website via the front-end.

#### 4.2 HOW TO USE THE FRONT-END.

Instructions are provided on each page of the front-end, to explain the correct way to use it and its intended purpose. If you need further explanation or any special assistance, please contact support. Alternatively, there are some videos available on YouTube which could help by way of demonstration.

### 6. <a name="SECTION6"></a>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
The following is a list of the directives available to CIDRAM in the `config.ini` configuration file, along with a description of the purpose of these directives.

#### "general" (Category)
General CIDRAM configuration.

"logfile"
- Human readable file for logging all blocked access attempts. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable.

"logfileApache"
- Apache-style file for logging all blocked access attempts. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable.

"logfileSerialized"
- Serialised file for logging all blocked access attempts. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable.

*Useful tip: If you want, you can append date/time information to the names of your logfiles by including these in the name: `{yyyy}` for complete year, `{yy}` for abbreviated year, `{mm}` for month, `{dd}` for day, `{hh}` for hour.*

*Examples:*
- *`logfile='logfile.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{hh}.txt'`*
- *`logfileApache='access.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{hh}.txt'`*
- *`logfileSerialized='serial.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{hh}.txt'`*

"truncate"
- Truncate logfiles when they reach a certain size? Value is the maximum size in B/KB/MB/GB/TB that a logfile may grow to before being truncated. The default value of 0KB disables truncation (logfiles can grow indefinitely). Note: Applies to individual logfiles! The size of logfiles is not considered collectively.

"log_rotation_limit"
- Log rotation limits the number of logfiles that should exist at any one time. When new logfiles are created, if the total number of logfiles exceeds the specified limit, the specified action will be performed. You can specify the desired limit here. A value of 0 will disable log rotation.

"log_rotation_action"
- Log rotation limits the number of logfiles that should exist at any one time. When new logfiles are created, if the total number of logfiles exceeds the specified limit, the specified action will be performed. You can specify the desired action here. Delete = Delete the oldest logfiles, until the limit is no longer exceeded. Archive = Firstly archive, and then delete the oldest logfiles, until the limit is no longer exceeded.

*Technical clarification: In this context, "oldest" means least recently modified.*

"timeOffset"
- If your server time doesn't match your local time, you can specify an offset here to adjust the date/time information generated by CIDRAM according to your needs. It's generally recommended instead to adjust the timezone directive in your `php.ini` file, but sometimes (such as when working with limited shared hosting providers) this isn't always possible to do, and so, this option is provided here. Offset is in minutes.
- Example (to add one hour): `timeOffset=60`

"timeFormat"
- The date/time notation format used by CIDRAM. Default = `{Day}, {dd} {Mon} {yyyy} {hh}:{ii}:{ss} {tz}`.

"ipaddr"
- Where to find the IP address of connecting requests? (Useful for services such as Cloudflare and the likes). Default = REMOTE_ADDR. WARNING: Don't change this unless you know what you're doing!

"forbid_on_block"
- Which headers should CIDRAM respond with when blocking requests? False/200 = 200 OK [Default]; True/403 = 403 Forbidden; 503 = 503 Service unavailable.

"silent_mode"
- Should CIDRAM silently redirect blocked access attempts instead of displaying the "Access Denied" page? If yes, specify the location to redirect blocked access attempts to. If no, leave this variable blank.

"lang"
- Specify the default language for CIDRAM.

"numbers"
- Specifies how to display numbers.

"emailaddr"
- If you wish, you can supply an email address here to be given to users when they're blocked, for them to use as a point of contact for support and/or assistance for in the event of them being blocked mistakenly or in error. WARNING: Whatever email address you supply here will most certainly be acquired by spambots and scrapers during the course of its being used here, and so, it's strongly recommended that if you choose to supply an email address here, that you ensure that the email address you supply here is a disposable address and/or an address that you don't mind being spammed (in other words, you probably don't want to use your primary personal or primary business email addresses).

"emailaddr_display_style"
- How would you prefer the email address to be presented to users? "default" = Clickable link. "noclick" = Non-clickable text.

"disable_cli"
- Disable CLI mode? CLI mode is enabled by default, but can sometimes interfere with certain testing tools (such as PHPUnit, for example) and other CLI-based applications. If you don't need to disable CLI mode, you should ignore this directive. False = Enable CLI mode [Default]; True = Disable CLI mode.

"disable_frontend"
- Disable front-end access? Front-end access can make CIDRAM more manageable, but can also be a potential security risk, too. It's recommended to manage CIDRAM via the back-end whenever possible, but front-end access is provided for when it isn't possible. Keep it disabled unless you need it. False = Enable front-end access; True = Disable front-end access [Default].

"max_login_attempts"
- Maximum number of login attempts (front-end). Default = 5.

"FrontEndLog"
- File for logging front-end login attempts. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable.

"ban_override"
- Override "forbid_on_block" when "infraction_limit" is exceeded? When overriding: Blocked requests return a blank page (template files aren't used). 200 = Don't override [Default]; 403 = Override with "403 Forbidden"; 503 = Override with "503 Service unavailable".

"log_banned_ips"
- Include blocked requests from banned IPs in the logfiles? True = Yes [Default]; False = No.

"default_dns"
- A comma delimited list of DNS servers to use for hostname lookups. Default = "8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4" (Google DNS). WARNING: Don't change this unless you know what you're doing!

"search_engine_verification"
- Attempt to verify requests from search engines? Verifying search engines ensures that they won't be banned as a result of exceeding the infraction limit (banning search engines from your website will usually have a negative effect upon your search engine ranking, SEO, etc). When verified, search engines can be blocked as per normal, but won't be banned. When not verified, it's possible for them to be banned as a result of exceeding the infraction limit. Additionally, search engine verification provides protection against fake search engine requests and against potentially malicious entities masquerading as search engines (such requests will be blocked when search engine verification is enabled). True = Enable search engine verification [Default]; False = Disable search engine verification.

"protect_frontend"
- Specifies whether the protections normally provided by CIDRAM should be applied to the front-end. True = Yes [Default]; False = No.

"disable_webfonts"
- Disable webfonts? True = Yes [Default]; False = No.

"maintenance_mode"
- Enable maintenance mode? True = Yes; False = No [Default]. Disables everything other than the front-end. Sometimes useful for when updating your CMS, frameworks, etc.

"default_algo"
- Defines which algorithm to use for all future passwords and sessions. Options: PASSWORD_DEFAULT (default), PASSWORD_BCRYPT, PASSWORD_ARGON2I (requires PHP >= 7.2.0).

"statistics"
- Track CIDRAM usage statistics? True = Yes; False = No [Default].

"force_hostname_lookup"
- Force hostname lookups? True = Yes; False = No [Default]. Hostname lookups are normally performed on an "as needed" basis, but can be forced for all requests. Doing so may be useful as a means of providing more detailed information in the logfiles, but may also have a slightly negative effect on performance.

"allow_gethostbyaddr_lookup"
- Allow gethostbyaddr lookups when UDP is unavailable? True = Yes [Default]; False = No.
- *Note: IPv6 lookup mightn't work correctly on some 32-bit systems.*

"hide_version"
- Hide version information from logs and page output? True = Yes; False = No [Default].

#### "signatures" (Category)
Signatures configuration.

"ipv4"
- A list of the IPv4 signature files that CIDRAM should attempt to parse, delimited by commas. You can add entries here if you want to include additional IPv4 signature files into CIDRAM.

"ipv6"
- A list of the IPv6 signature files that CIDRAM should attempt to parse, delimited by commas. You can add entries here if you want to include additional IPv6 signature files into CIDRAM.

"block_cloud"
- Block CIDRs identified as belonging to webhosting/cloud services? If you operate an API service from your website or if you expect other websites to connect to your website, this should be set to false. If you don't, then, this directive should be set to true.

"block_bogons"
- Block bogon/martian CIDRs? If you expect connections to your website from within your local network, from localhost, or from your LAN, this directive should be set to false. If you don't expect these such connections, this directive should be set to true.

"block_generic"
- Block CIDRs generally recommended for blacklisting? This covers any signatures that aren't marked as being part of any of the other more specific signature categories.

"block_legal"
- Block CIDRs in response to legal obligations? This directive shouldn't normally have any effect, because CIDRAM doesn't associate any CIDRs with "legal obligations" by default, but it exists nonetheless as an additional control measure for the benefit of any custom signature files or modules that might exist for legal reasons.

"block_malware"
- Block IPs associated with malware? This includes C&C servers, infected machines, machines involved in malware distribution, etc.

"block_proxies"
- Block CIDRs identified as belonging to proxy services or VPNs? If you require that users be able to access your website from proxy services and VPNs, this directive should be set to false. Otherwise, if you don't require proxy services or VPNs, this directive should be set to true as a means of improving security.

"block_spam"
- Block CIDRs identified as being high-risk for spam? Unless you experience problems when doing so, generally, this should always be set to true.

"modules"
- A list of module files to load after checking the IPv4/IPv6 signatures, delimited by commas.

"default_tracktime"
- How many seconds to track IPs banned by modules. Default = 604800 (1 week).

"infraction_limit"
- Maximum number of infractions an IP is allowed to incur before it is banned by IP tracking. Default = 10.

"track_mode"
- When should infractions be counted? False = When IPs are blocked by modules. True = When IPs are blocked for any reason.

#### "recaptcha" (Category)
Optionally, you can provide users with a way to bypass the "Access Denied" page by way of completing a reCAPTCHA instance, if you want to do so. This can help to mitigate some of the risks associated with false positives in those situations where we're not entirely sure whether a request has originated from a machine or a human.

Due to the risks associated with providing a way for end-users to bypass the "Access Denied" page, generally, I would advise against enabling this feature unless you feel it to be necessary to do so. Situations where it could be necessary: If your website has customers/users that need to have access to your website, and if this is something that can't be compromised on, but if those customers/users happen to be connecting from a hostile network that could potentially also be carrying undesirable traffic, and blocking this undesirable traffic is also something that can't be compromised on, in those particular no-win situations, the reCAPTCHA feature could come in handy as a means of allowing the desirable customers/users, while keeping out the undesirable traffic from the same network. That said though, given that the intended purpose of a CAPTCHA is to distinguish between humans and non-humans, the reCAPTCHA feature would only assist in these no-win situations if we're to assume that this undesirable traffic is non-human (e.g., spambots, scrapers, hacktools, automated traffic), as opposed to being undesirable human traffic (such as human spammers, hackers, et al).

To obtain a "site key" and a "secret key" (required for using reCAPTCHA), please go to: [https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/)

"usemode"
- Defines how CIDRAM should use reCAPTCHA.
- 0 = reCAPTCHA is completely disabled (default).
- 1 = reCAPTCHA is enabled for all signatures.
- 2 = reCAPTCHA is enabled only for signatures belonging to sections specially marked as reCAPTCHA-enabled within the signature files.
- (Any other value will be treated in the same way as 0).

"lockip"
- Specifies whether hashes should be locked to specific IPs. False = Cookies and hashes CAN be used across multiple IPs (default). True = Cookies and hashes CAN'T be used across multiple IPs (cookies/hashes are locked to IPs).
- Note: "lockip" value is ignored when "lockuser" is false, due to that the mechanism for remembering "users" differs depending on this value.

"lockuser"
- Specifies whether successful completion of a reCAPTCHA instance should be locked to specific users. False = Successful completion of a reCAPTCHA instance will grant access to all requests originating from the same IP as that used by the user completing the reCAPTCHA instance; Cookies and hashes aren't used; Instead, an IP whitelist will be used. True = Successful completion of a reCAPTCHA instance will only grant access to the user completing the reCAPTCHA instance; Cookies and hashes are used to remember the user; An IP whitelist is not used (default).

"sitekey"
- This value should correspond to the "site key" for your reCAPTCHA, which can be found within the reCAPTCHA dashboard.

"secret"
- This value should correspond to the "secret key" for your reCAPTCHA, which can be found within the reCAPTCHA dashboard.

"expiry"
- When "lockuser" is true (default), in order to remember when a user has successfully passed a reCAPTCHA instance, for future page requests, CIDRAM generates a standard HTTP cookie containing a hash which corresponds to an internal record containing that same hash; Future page requests will use these corresponding hashes to authenticate that a user has previously already passed a reCAPTCHA instance. When "lockuser" is false, an IP whitelist is used to determine whether requests should be permitted from the IP of inbound requests; Entries are added to this whitelist when the reCAPTCHA instance is successfully passed. For how many hours should these cookies, hashes and whitelist entries remain valid? Default = 720 (1 month).

"logfile"
- Log all reCAPTCHA attempts? If yes, specify the name to use for the logfile. If no, leave this variable blank.

*Useful tip: If you want, you can append date/time information to the names of your logfiles by including these in the name: `{yyyy}` for complete year, `{yy}` for abbreviated year, `{mm}` for month, `{dd}` for day, `{hh}` for hour.*

*Examples:*
- *`logfile='recaptcha.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}-{hh}.txt'`*

"signature_limit"
- Maximum number of signatures allowed to be triggered when a reCAPTCHA instance is to be offered. Default = 1. If this number is exceeded for any particular request, a reCAPTCHA instance won't be offered.

"api"
- Which API to use? V2 or Invisible?

*Note for users in the European Union: When CIDRAM is configured to use cookies (e.g., when "lockuser" is true), a cookie warning is displayed prominently on the page as per the requirements of [EU cookie legislation](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm). However, when using the invisible API, CIDRAM attempts to complete the reCAPTCHA for the user automatically, and when successful, this could result in the page being reloaded and a cookie being created without the user being given adequate time to actually see the cookie warning. If this poses a legal risk for you, it may be better to use the V2 API instead of the invisible API (the V2 API is not automated, and requires that the user completes the reCAPTCHA challenge themselves, thus providing an opportunity to see the cookie warning).*

#### "legal" (Category)
Configuration relating to legal requirements.

*For more information about legal requirements and how this could affect your configuration requirements, please refer to the "[LEGAL INFORMATION](#SECTION11)" section of the documentation.*

"pseudonymise_ip_addresses"
- Pseudonymise IP addresses when logging? True = Yes; False = No [Default].

"omit_ip"
- Omit IP addresses from logs? True = Yes; False = No [Default]. Note: "pseudonymise_ip_addresses" becomes redundant when "omit_ip" is "true".

"omit_hostname"
- Omit hostnames from logs? True = Yes; False = No [Default].

"omit_ua"
- Omit user agents from logs? True = Yes; False = No [Default].

"privacy_policy"
- The address of a relevant privacy policy to be displayed in the footer of any generated pages. Specify a URL, or leave blank to disable.

#### "template_data" (Category)
Directives/Variables for templates and themes.

Relates to the HTML output used to generate the "Access Denied" page. If you're using custom themes for CIDRAM, HTML output is sourced from the `template_custom.html` file, and otherwise, HTML output is sourced from the `template.html` file. Variables written to this section of the configuration file are parsed to the HTML output by way of replacing any variable names circumfixed by curly brackets found within the HTML output with the corresponding variable data. For example, where `foo="bar"`, any instance of `<p>{foo}</p>` found within the HTML output will become `<p>bar</p>`.

"theme"
- Default theme to use for CIDRAM.

"Magnification"
- Font magnification. Default = 1.

"css_url"
- The template file for custom themes utilises external CSS properties, whereas the template file for the default theme utilises internal CSS properties. To instruct CIDRAM to use the template file for custom themes, specify the public HTTP address of your custom theme's CSS files using the `css_url` variable. If you leave this variable blank, CIDRAM will use the template file for the default theme.

### 7. <a name="SECTION7"></a>SIGNATURE FORMAT

*See also:*
- *[What is a "signature"?](#WHAT_IS_A_SIGNATURE)*

#### 7.0 BASICS (FOR SIGNATURE FILES)

A description of the format and structure of the signatures used by CIDRAM can be found documented in plain-text within either of the two custom signature files. Please refer to that documentation to learn more about the format and structure of the signatures of CIDRAM.

All IPv4 signatures follow the format: `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/yy [Function] [Param]`.
- `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` represents the beginning of the CIDR block (the octets of the initial IP address in the block).
- `yy` represents the CIDR block size [1-32].
- `[Function]` instructs the script what to do with the signature (how the signature should be regarded).
- `[Param]` represents whatever additional information may be required by `[Function]`.

All IPv6 signatures follow the format: `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::xxxx/yy [Function] [Param]`.
- `xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::xxxx` represents the beginning of the CIDR block (the octets of the initial IP address in the block). Complete notation and abbreviated notation are both acceptable (and each MUST follow the appropriate and relevant standards of IPv6 notation, but with one exception: an IPv6 address can never begin with an abbreviation when used in a signature for this script, due to the way in which CIDRs are reconstructed by the script; For example, `::1/128` should be expressed, when used in a signature, as `0::1/128`, and `::0/128` expressed as `0::/128`).
- `yy` represents the CIDR block size [1-128].
- `[Function]` instructs the script what to do with the signature (how the signature should be regarded).
- `[Param]` represents whatever additional information may be required by `[Function]`.

The signature files for CIDRAM SHOULD use Unix-style linebreaks (`%0A`, or `\n`)! Other types/styles of linebreaks (e.g., Windows `%0D%0A` or `\r\n` linebreaks, Mac `%0D` or `\r` linebreaks, etc) MAY be used, but are NOT preferred. Non-Unix-style linebreaks will be normalised to Unix-style linebreaks by the script.

Precise and correct CIDR notation is required, otherwise the script will NOT recognise the signatures. Additionally, all the CIDR signatures of this script MUST begin with an IP address whose IP number can divide evenly into the block division represented by its CIDR block size (e.g., if you wanted to block all IPs from `10.128.0.0` to `11.127.255.255`, `10.128.0.0/8` would NOT be recognised by the script, but `10.128.0.0/9` and `11.0.0.0/9` used in conjunction, WOULD be recognised by the script).

Anything in the signature files not recognised as a signature nor as signature-related syntax by the script will be IGNORED, therefore meaning that you can safely put any non-signature data that you want into the signature files without breaking them and without breaking the script. Comments are acceptable in the signature files, and no special formatting is required for them. Shell-style hashing for comments is preferred, but not enforced; Functionally, it makes no difference to the script whether or not you choose to use Shell-style hashing for comments, but using Shell-style hashing helps IDEs and plain-text editors to correctly highlight the various parts of the signature files (and so, Shell-style hashing can assist as a visual aid while editing).

The possible values of `[Function]` are as follows:
- Run
- Whitelist
- Greylist
- Deny

If "Run" is used, when the signature is triggered, the script will attempt to execute (using a `require_once` statement) an external PHP script, specified by the `[Param]` value (the working directory should be the "/vault/" directory of the script).

Example: `127.0.0.0/8 Run example.php`

This can be useful if you want to execute some specific PHP code for some specific IPs and/or CIDRs.

If "Whitelist" is used, when the signature is triggered, the script will reset all detections (if there's been any detections) and break the test function. `[Param]` is ignored. This function is the equivalent of whitelisting a particular IP or CIDR from being detected.

Example: `127.0.0.1/32 Whitelist`

If "Greylist" is used, when the signature is triggered, the script will reset all detections (if there's been any detections) and skip to the next signature file to continue processing. `[Param]` is ignored.

Example: `127.0.0.1/32 Greylist`

If "Deny" is used, when the signature is triggered, assuming no whitelist signature has been triggered for the given IP address and/or given CIDR, access to the protected page will be denied. "Deny" is what you'll want to use to actually block an IP address and/or CIDR range. When any signatures are triggered that make use of "Deny", the "Access Denied" page of the script will be generated and the request to the protected page killed.

The `[Param]` value accepted by "Deny" will be parsed to the "Access Denied" page output, supplied to the client/user as the cited reason for their access to the requested page being denied. It can be either a short and simple sentence, explaining why you've chosen to block them (anything should suffice, even a simple "I don't want you on my website"), or one of a small handful of shorthand words supplied by the script, that if used, will be replaced by the script with a pre-prepared explanation of why the client/user has been blocked.

The pre-prepared explanations have L10N support and can be translated by the script based upon the language you specify to the `lang` directive of the script configuration. Additionally, you can instruct the script to ignore "Deny" signatures based upon their `[Param]` value (if they're using these shorthand words) via the directives specified by the script configuration (each shorthand word has a corresponding directive to either process the corresponding signatures or to ignore them). `[Param]` values that don't use these shorthand words, however, don't have L10N support and therefore WON'T be translated by the script, and additionally, aren't directly controllable by the script configuration.

The available shorthand words are:
- Bogon
- Cloud
- Generic
- Proxy
- Spam
- Legal
- Malware

#### 7.1 TAGS

##### 7.1.0 SECTION TAGS

If you want to split your custom signatures into individual sections, you can identify these individual sections to the script by adding a "section tag" immediately after the signatures of each section, along with the name of your signature section (see the example below).

```
# Section 1.
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Bogon
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Cloud
4.5.6.7/32 Deny Generic
5.6.7.8/32 Deny Spam
6.7.8.9/32 Deny Proxy
Tag: Section 1
```

To break section tagging and to ensure that tags aren't incorrectly identified to signature sections from earlier in the signature files, simply ensure that there are at least two consecutive linebreaks between your tag and your earlier signature sections. Any untagged signatures will default to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" (depending on which types of signatures are being triggered).

```
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Bogon
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Cloud

4.5.6.7/32 Deny Generic
5.6.7.8/32 Deny Spam
Tag: Section 1
```

In the above example `1.2.3.4/32` and `2.3.4.5/32` will be tagged as "IPv4", whereas `4.5.6.7/32` and `5.6.7.8/32` will be tagged as "Section 1".

The same logic can be applied for separating other types of tags, too.

In particular, section tags can be very useful for debugging when false positives occur, by providing an easy means of locating the exact source of the problem, and can be very useful for filtering logfile entries when viewing logfiles via the front-end logs page (section names are clickable via the front-end logs page and can be used as a filtering criteria). If section tags are omitted for some particular signatures, when those signatures are triggered, CIDRAM uses the name of the signature file along with the type of IP address blocked (IPv4 or IPv6) as a fallback, and thus, section tags are entirely optional. They may be recommend in some cases though, such as when signature files are vaguely named or when it may otherwise be difficult to clearly identify the source of the signatures causing a request to be blocked.

##### 7.1.1 EXPIRY TAGS

If you want signatures to expire after some time, in a similar manner to section tags, you can use an "expiry tag" to specify when signatures should cease to be valid. Expiry tags use the format "YYYY.MM.DD" (see the example below).

```
# Section 1.
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Generic
Expires: 2016.12.31
```

Expired signatures will never be triggered on any request, no matter what.

##### 7.1.2 ORIGIN TAGS

If you want to specify the country of origin for some particular signature, you can do so using an "origin tag". An origin tag accepts an "[ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)" code corresponding to the country of origin for the signatures that it applies to. These codes must be written in upper-case (lower-case or mixed-case won't render correctly). When an origin tag is used, it is added to the "Why blocked" log field entry for any requests blocked as a result of the signatures that the tag is applied to.

If the optional "flags CSS" component is installed, when viewing logfiles via the front-end logs page, information appended by origin tags is replaced with the flag of the country corresponding to that information. This information, whether in its raw form or as a country flag, is clickable, and when clicked on, will filter log entries by way of other similarly identifying log entries (effectively allowing those accessing the logs page to filter by way of country of origin).

Note: Technically, this isn't any form of geolocation, due to that it doesn't involve looking up any specific information relating to inbound IPs, but rather, simply allows us to explicitly state a country of origin for any requests blocked by specific signatures. Multiple origin tags are permissible within the same signature section.

Hypothetical example:

```
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic
Origin: CN
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Generic
Origin: FR
4.5.6.7/32 Deny Generic
Origin: DE
6.7.8.9/32 Deny Generic
Origin: US
Tag: Foobar
```

Any tags may be used in conjunction, and all tags are optional (see the example below).

```
# Example Section.
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic
Origin: US
Tag: Example Section
Expires: 2016.12.31
```

#### 7.2 YAML

##### 7.2.0 YAML BASICS

A simplified form of YAML markup may be used in signature files for the purpose of defining behaviours and settings specific to individual signature sections. This may be useful if you want the value of your configuration directives to differ on the basis of individual signatures and signature sections (for example; if you want to supply an email address for support tickets for any users blocked by one particular signature, but don't want to supply an email address for support tickets for users blocked by any other signatures; if you want some specific signatures to trigger a page redirect; if you want to mark a signature section for use with reCAPTCHA; if you want to log blocked access attempts to separate files on the basis of individual signatures and/or signature sections).

Use of YAML markup in the signature files is entirely optional (i.e., you may use it if you wish to do so, but you are not required to do so), and is able to leverage most (but not all) configuration directives.

Note: YAML markup implementation in CIDRAM is very simplistic and very limited; It is intended to fulfill requirements specific to CIDRAM in a manner that has the familiarity of YAML markup, but neither follows nor complies with official specifications (and therefore won't behave in the same way as more thorough implementations elsewhere, and may not be appropriate for other projects elsewhere).

In CIDRAM, YAML markup segments are identified to the script by three dashes ("---"), and terminate alongside their containing signature sections by double-linebreaks. A typical YAML markup segment within a signature section consists of three dashes on a line immediately after the list of CIDRS and any tags, followed by a two dimensional list of key-value pairs (first dimension, configuration directive categories; second dimension, configuration directives) for which configuration directives should be modified (and to which values) whenever a signature within that signature section is triggered (see the examples below).

```
# Foobar 1.
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Generic
4.5.6.7/32 Deny Generic
Tag: Foobar 1
---
general:

4.5.6.7/32 Deny Generic
Tag: Foobar 2
---
general:
 logfile: "logfile.Foobar2.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.txt"
 logfileApache: "access.Foobar2.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.txt"
 logfileSerialized: "serial.Foobar2.{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.txt"
 forbid_on_block: 503

# Foobar 3.
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Generic
4.5.6.7/32 Deny Generic
Tag: Foobar 3
---
general:
 forbid_on_block: 403
 silent_mode: "http://127.0.0.1/"
```

##### 7.2.1 HOW TO "SPECIALLY MARK" SIGNATURE SECTIONS FOR USE WITH reCAPTCHA

When "usemode" is 0 or 1, signature sections don't need to be "specially marked" for use with reCAPTCHA (because they already either will or won't use reCAPTCHA, depending on this setting).

When "usemode" is 2, to "specially mark" signature sections for use with reCAPTCHA, an entry is included in the YAML segment for that signature section (see the example below).

```
# This section will use reCAPTCHA.
1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic
2.3.4.5/32 Deny Generic
Tag: reCAPTCHA-Enabled
---
recaptcha:
 enabled: true
```

*Note: By default, a reCAPTCHA instance will ONLY be offered to the user if reCAPTCHA is enabled (either with "usemode" as 1, or "usemode" as 2 with "enabled" as true), and if exactly ONE signature has been triggered (no more, no less; if multiple signatures are triggered, a reCAPTCHA instance will NOT be offered). However, this behaviour can be modified via the "signature_limit" directive.*

#### 7.3 AUXILIARY

In addition, if you want CIDRAM to completely ignore some specific sections within any of the signature files, you can use the `ignore.dat` file to specify which sections to ignore. On a new line, write `Ignore`, followed by a space, followed by the name of the section that you want CIDRAM to ignore (see the example below).

```
Ignore Section 1
```

#### 7.4 <a name="MODULE_BASICS"></a>BASICS (FOR MODULES)

Modules can be used to extend the functionality of CIDRAM, perform additional tasks, or process additional logic. Typically, they're used when it's necessary to block a request on a basis other than its originating IP address (and thus, when a CIDR signature won't suffice to block the request). Modules are written as PHP files, and thus, typically, module signatures are written as PHP code.

Some good examples of CIDRAM modules can be found here:
- https://github.com/CIDRAM/CIDRAM-Extras/tree/master/modules

A template for writing new modules can be found here:
- https://github.com/CIDRAM/CIDRAM-Extras/blob/master/modules/module_template.php

Due to that modules are written as PHP files, if you're adequately familiar with the CIDRAM codebase, you can structure your modules however you want, and write your module signatures however you want (within reason of what is possible with PHP). However, for your own convenience, and for the sake of better mutual intelligibility between existing modules and your own, analysing the template linked above is recommended, in order to be able to use the structure and format that it provides.

*Note: If you're not comfortable working with PHP code, writing your own modules is not recommended.*

Some functionality is provided by CIDRAM for modules to use, which should make it simpler and easier to write your own modules. Information about this functionality is described below.

#### 7.5 MODULE FUNCTIONALITY

##### 7.5.0 "$Trigger"

Module signatures are typically written with "$Trigger". In most cases, this closure will be more important than anything else for the purpose of writing modules.

"$Trigger" accepts 4 parameters: "$Condition", "$ReasonShort", "$ReasonLong" (optional), and "$DefineOptions" (optional).

The truthiness of "$Condition" is evaluated, and if true, the signature is "triggered". If false, the signature is *not* "triggered". "$Condition" typically contains PHP code to evaluate a condition that should cause a request to be blocked.

"$ReasonShort" is cited in the "Why Blocked" field when the signature is "triggered".

"$ReasonLong" is an optional message to be displayed to the user/client for when they're blocked, to explain why they've been blocked. Defaults to the standard "Access Denied" message when omitted.

"$DefineOptions" is an optional array containing key/value pairs, used to define configuration options specific to the request instance. Configuration options will be applied when the signature is "triggered".

"$Trigger" returns true when the signature is "triggered", and false when it isn't.

To use this closure in your module, remember firstly to inherit it from the parent scope:
```PHP
$Trigger = $CIDRAM['Trigger'];
```

##### 7.5.1 "$Bypass"

Signature bypasses are typically written with "$Bypass".

"$Bypass" accepts 3 parameters: "$Condition", "$ReasonShort", and "$DefineOptions" (optional).

The truthiness of "$Condition" is evaluated, and if true, the bypass is "triggered". If false, the bypass is *not* "triggered". "$Condition" typically contains PHP code to evaluate a condition that should *not* cause a request to be blocked.

"$ReasonShort" is cited in the "Why Blocked" field when the bypass is "triggered".

"$DefineOptions" is an optional array containing key/value pairs, used to define configuration options specific to the request instance. Configuration options will be applied when the bypass is "triggered".

"$Bypass" returns true when the bypass is "triggered", and false when it isn't.

To use this closure in your module, remember firstly to inherit it from the parent scope:
```PHP
$Bypass = $CIDRAM['Bypass'];
```

##### 7.5.2 "$CIDRAM['DNS-Reverse']"

This can be used to fetch the hostname of an IP address. If you want to create a module to block hostnames, this closure could be useful.

Example:
```PHP
<?php
/** Inherit trigger closure (see functions.php). */
$Trigger = $CIDRAM['Trigger'];

/** Fetch hostname. */
if (empty($CIDRAM['Hostname'])) {
    $CIDRAM['Hostname'] = $CIDRAM['DNS-Reverse']($CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['IPAddr']);
}

/** Example signature. */
if ($CIDRAM['Hostname'] && $CIDRAM['Hostname'] !== $CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['IPAddr']) {
    $Trigger($CIDRAM['Hostname'] === 'www.foobar.tld', 'Foobar.tld', 'Hostname Foobar.tld is not allowed.');
}
```

#### 7.6 MODULE VARIABLES

Modules execute within their own scope, and any variables defined by a module, won't be accessible to other modules, or to the parent script, unless they're stored in the "$CIDRAM" array (everything else is flushed after the module execution finishes).

Listed below are some common variables that might be useful for your module:

Variable | Description
----|----
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['DateTime']` | The current date and time.
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['IPAddr']` | IP address for the current request.
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['ScriptIdent']` | CIDRAM script version.
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['Query']` | The query for the current request.
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['Referrer']` | The referrer for the current request (if one exists).
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['UA']` | The user agent for the current request.
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['UALC']` | The user agent for the current request (lower-cased).
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['ReasonMessage']` | The message to be displayed to the user/client for the current request if they're blocked.
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['SignatureCount']` | The number of signatures triggered for the current request.
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['Signatures']` | Reference information for any signatures triggered for the current request.
`$CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['WhyReason']` | Reference information for any signatures triggered for the current request.

#### <a name="WHAT_IS_A_SIGNATURE"></a>What is a "signature"?

In the context of CIDRAM, a "signature" refers to data that acts as an indicator/identifier for something specific that we're looking for, usually an IP address or CIDR, and includes some instruction for CIDRAM, telling it the best way to respond when it encounters what we're looking for. A typical signature for CIDRAM looks something like this:

For "signature files":

`1.2.3.4/32 Deny Generic`

For "modules":

```PHP
$Trigger(strpos($CIDRAM['BlockInfo']['UA'], 'Foobar') !== false, 'Foobar-UA', 'User agent "Foobar" not allowed.');
```

*Note: Signatures for "signature files", and signatures for "modules", are not the same thing.*

Often (but not always), signatures will bundled together in groups, forming "signature sections", often accompanied by comments, markup, and/or related metadata that can be used to provide additional context for the signatures and/or further instruction.

#### <a name="WHAT_IS_A_CIDR"></a>What is a "CIDR"?

"CIDR" is an acronym for "Classless Inter-Domain Routing" *[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing), [2](http://whatismyipaddress.com/cidr)]*, and it's this acronym that's used as part of the name for this package, "CIDRAM", which is an acronym for "Classless Inter-Domain Routing Access Manager".

However, in the context of CIDRAM (such as, within this documentation, within discussions relating to CIDRAM, or within the CIDRAM language data), whenever a "CIDR" (singular) or "CIDRs" (plural) is mentioned or referred to (and thus whereby we use these words as nouns in their own right, as opposed to as acronyms), what's intended and meant by this is a subnet (or subnets), expressed using CIDR notation. The reason that CIDR (or CIDRs) is used instead of subnet (or subnets) is to make it clear that it's specifically subnets expressed using CIDR notation that's being referred to (because CIDR notation is just one of several different ways that subnets can be expressed). CIDRAM could, therefore, be considered a "subnet access manager".

Although this dual meaning of "CIDR" may present some ambiguity in some cases, this explanation, along with the context provided, should help to resolve such ambiguity.

#### <a name="WHAT_IS_A_FALSE_POSITIVE"></a>What is a "false positive"?

The term "false positive" (*alternatively: "false positive error"; "false alarm"*), described very simply, and in a generalised context, is used when testing for a condition, to refer to the results of that test, when the results are positive (i.e., the condition is determined to be "positive", or "true"), but are expected to be (or should have been) negative (i.e., the condition, in reality, is "negative", or "false"). A "false positive" could be considered analogous to "crying wolf" (wherein the condition being tested is whether there's a wolf near the herd, the condition is "false" in that there's no wolf near the herd, and the condition is reported as "positive" by the shepherd by way of calling "wolf, wolf"), or analogous to situations in medical testing wherein a patient is diagnosed as having some illness or disease, when in reality, they have no such illness or disease.

Related outcomes when testing for a condition can be described using the terms "true positive", "true negative" and "false negative". A "true positive" refers to when the results of the test and the actual state of the condition are both true (or "positive"), and a "true negative" refers to when the results of the test and the actual state of the condition are both false (or "negative"); A "true positive" or a "true negative" is considered to be a "correct inference". The antithesis of a "false positive" is a "false negative"; A "false negative" refers to when the results of the test are negative (i.e., the condition is determined to be "negative", or "false"), but are expected to be (or should have been) positive (i.e., the condition, in reality, is "positive", or "true").

In the context of CIDRAM, these terms refer to the signatures of CIDRAM and what/whom they block. When CIDRAM blocks an IP address due to bad, outdated or incorrect signatures, but shouldn't have done so, or when it does so for the wrong reasons, we refer to this event as a "false positive". When CIDRAM fails to block an IP address that should have been blocked, due to unforeseen threats, missing signatures or shortfalls in its signatures, we refer to this event as a "missed detection" (which is analogous to a "false negative").

This can be summarised by the table below:

&nbsp; | CIDRAM should *NOT* block an IP address | CIDRAM *SHOULD* block an IP address
---|---|---
CIDRAM does *NOT* block an IP address | True negative (correct inference) | Missed detection (analogous to false negative)
CIDRAM *DOES* block an IP address | __False positive__ | True positive (correct inference)

#### <a name="BLOCK_ENTIRE_COUNTRIES"></a>Can CIDRAM block entire countries?

Yes. The easiest way to achieve this would be to install some of the optional country blocklists provided by Macmathan. This can be done with a few simple clicks directly from the front-end updates page, or, if you'd prefer for the front-end to remain disabled, by downloading them directly from the **[optional blocklists download page](https://macmathan.info/blocklists)**, uploading them to the vault, and citing their names in the relevant configuration directives.

#### <a name="SIGNATURE_UPDATE_FREQUENCY"></a>How frequently are signatures updated?

Update frequency varies depending on the signature files in question. All maintainers for CIDRAM signature files generally try to keep their signatures as up-to-date as is possible, but as all of us have various other commitments, our lives outside the project, and as none of us are financially compensated (i.e., paid) for our efforts on the project, a precise update schedule can't be guaranteed. Generally, signatures are updated whenever there's enough time to update them, and generally, maintainers try to prioritise based on necessity and on how frequently changes occur among ranges. Assistance is always appreciated if you're willing to offer any.

#### <a name="ENCOUNTERED_PROBLEM_WHAT_TO_DO"></a>I've encountered a problem while using CIDRAM and I don't know what to do about it! Please help!

- Are you using the latest version of the software? Are you using the latest versions of your signature files? If the answer to either of these two questions is no, try to update everything first, and check whether the problem persists. If it persists, continue reading.
- Have you checked through all the documentation? If not, please do so. If the problem can't be solved using the documentation, continue reading.
- Have you checked the **[issues page](https://github.com/CIDRAM/CIDRAM/issues)**, to see whether the problem has been mentioned before? If it's been mentioned before, check whether any suggestions, ideas, and/or solutions were provided, and follow as per necessary to try to resolve the problem.
- If the problem still persists, please seek help about it by creating a new issue on the issues page.

#### <a name="BLOCKED_WHAT_TO_DO"></a>I've been blocked by CIDRAM from a website that I want to visit! Please help!

CIDRAM provides a means for website owners to block undesirable traffic, but it's the responsibility of website owners to decide for themselves how they want to use CIDRAM. In case of the false positives relating to the signature files normally included with CIDRAM, corrections can be made, but in regards to being unblocked from specific websites, you'll need to take that up with the owners of the websites in question. In cases where corrections are made, at the very least, they'll need to update their signature files and/or installation, and in other cases (such as, for example, where they've modified their installation, created their own custom signatures, etc), the responsibility to solve your problem is entirely theirs, and is entirely outside our control.

#### <a name="MINIMUM_PHP_VERSION"></a>I want to use CIDRAM with a PHP version older than 5.4.0; Can you help?

No. PHP 5.4.0 reached official EoL ("End of Life") in 2014, and extended security support was terminated in 2015. As of writing this, it is 2017, and PHP 7.1.0 is already available. At this time, support is provided for using CIDRAM with PHP 5.4.0 and all available newer PHP versions, but if you try to use CIDRAM with any older PHP versions, support won't be provided.

*See also: [Compatibility Charts](https://maikuolan.github.io/Compatibility-Charts/).*

#### <a name="PROTECT_MULTIPLE_DOMAINS"></a>Can I use a single CIDRAM installation to protect multiple domains?

Yes. CIDRAM installations are not naturally locked to specific domains, and can therefore be used to protect multiple domains. Generally, we refer to CIDRAM installations protecting only one domain as "single-domain installations", and we refer to CIDRAM installations protecting multiple domains and/or sub-domains as "multi-domain installations". If you operate a multi-domain installation and need to use different sets of signature files for different domains, or need CIDRAM to be configured differently for different domains, it's possible to do this. After loading the configuration file (`config.ini`), CIDRAM will check for the existence of a "configuration overrides file" specific to the domain (or sub-domain) being requested (`the-domain-being-requested.tld.config.ini`), and if found, any configuration values defined by the configuration overrides file will be used for the execution instance instead of the configuration values defined by the configuration file. Configuration overrides files are identical to the configuration file, and at your discretion, may contain either the entirety of all configuration directives available to CIDRAM, or whichever small subsection required which differs from the values normally defined by the configuration file. Configuration overrides files are named according to the domain that they are intended for (so, for example, if you need a configuration overrides file for the domain, `http://www.some-domain.tld/`, its configuration overrides file should be named as `some-domain.tld.config.ini`, and should be placed within the vault alongside the configuration file, `config.ini`). The domain name for the execution instance is derived from the `HTTP_HOST` header of the request; "www" is ignored.

#### <a name="PAY_YOU_TO_DO_IT"></a>I don't want to mess around with installing this and getting it to work with my website; Can I just pay you to do it all for me?

Maybe. This is considered on a case-by-case basis. Let us know what you need, what you're offering, and we'll let you know whether we can help.

#### <a name="HIRE_FOR_PRIVATE_WORK"></a>Can I hire you or any of the developers of this project for private work?

*See above.*

#### <a name="SPECIALIST_MODIFICATIONS"></a>I need specialist modifications, customisations, etc; Can you help?

*See above.*

#### <a name="ACCEPT_OR_OFFER_WORK"></a>I'm a developer, website designer, or programmer. Can I accept or offer work relating to this project?

Yes. Our license does not prohibit this.

#### <a name="WANT_TO_CONTRIBUTE"></a>I want to contribute to the project; Can I do this?

Yes. Contributions to the project are very welcome. Please see "CONTRIBUTING.md" for more information.

#### <a name="RECOMMENDED_VALUES_FOR_IPADDR"></a>Recommended values for "ipaddr".

Value | Using
---|---
`HTTP_INCAP_CLIENT_IP` | Incapsula reverse proxy.
`HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP` | Cloudflare reverse proxy.
`CF-Connecting-IP` | Cloudflare reverse proxy (alternative; if the above doesn't work).
`HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` | Cloudbric reverse proxy.
`X-Forwarded-For` | [Squid reverse proxy](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/forwarded_for/).
*Defined by server configuration.* | [Nginx reverse proxy](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/).
`REMOTE_ADDR` | No reverse proxy (default value).

#### <a name="CRON_TO_UPDATE_AUTOMATICALLY"></a>Can I use cron to update automatically?

Yes. An API is built into the front-end for interacting with the updates page via external scripts. A separate script, "[Cronable](https://github.com/Maikuolan/Cronable)", is available, and can be used by your cron manager or cron scheduler to update this and other supported packages automatically (this script provides its own documentation).

#### <a name="WHAT_ARE_INFRACTIONS"></a>What are "infractions"?

"Infractions" determine when an IP that isn't yet blocked by any specific signature files should start being blocked for any future requests, and they are closely associated with IP tracking. Some functionality and modules exist that allow requests to be blocked for reasons other than the IP of origin (such as the presence of user agents corresponding to spambots or hacktools, dangerous queries, spoofed DNS and so on), and when this happens, an "infraction" can occur. They provide a way to identify IP addresses that correspond to unwanted requests that mightn't yet be blocked by any specific signature files. Infractions usually correspond 1-to-1 with the number of times an IP is blocked, but not always (severe block events may incur an infraction value greater than one, and if "track_mode" is false, infractions won't occur for block events triggered solely by signature files).

#### <a name="BLOCK_HOSTNAMES"></a>Can CIDRAM block hostnames?

Yes. To do this, you'll need to create a custom module file. *See: [BASICS (FOR MODULES)](#MODULE_BASICS)*.

#### <a name="WHAT_CAN_I_USE_FOR_DEFAULT_DNS"></a>What can I use for "default_dns"?

Generally, the IP of any reliable DNS server should suffice. If you're looking for suggestions, [public-dns.info](https://public-dns.info/) and [OpenNIC](https://servers.opennic.org/) provide extensive lists of known, public DNS servers. Alternatively, see the table below:

#### <a name="PROTECT_OTHER_THINGS"></a>Can I use CIDRAM to protect things other than websites (e.g., email servers, FTP, SSH, IRC, etc)?

You can (legally), but shouldn't (technically; practically). Our license does not limit which technologies implement CIDRAM, but CIDRAM is a WAF (Web Application Firewall) and has always been intended to protect websites. Because it wasn't designed with other technologies in mind, it's unlikely to be effective or provide reliable protection for other technologies, implementation is likely to be difficult, and the risk of false positives and missed detections is very high.

#### <a name="CDN_CACHING_PROBLEMS"></a>Will problems occur if I use CIDRAM at the same time as using CDNs or caching services?

Maybe. This depends on the nature of the service in question, and how you're using it. Generally, if you're only caching static assets (images, CSS, etc; anything that doesn't generally change over time), there shouldn't be any problems. There may be problems though, if you're caching data that would otherwise typically be generated dynamically when requested, or if you're caching the results of POST requests (this would essentially render your website and its environment as obligatorily static, and CIDRAM is unlikely to provide any meaningful benefit in an obligatorily static environment). There may also be specific configuration requirements for CIDRAM, depending on which CDN or caching service you're using (you'll need to ensure that CIDRAM is configured correctly for the specific CDN or caching service that you're using). Failure to configure CIDRAM correctly may lead to significantly problematic false positives and missed detections.

### 11. <a name="SECTION11"></a>LEGAL INFORMATION

#### 11.0 SECTION PREAMBLE

This section of the documentation is intended to describe possible legal considerations regarding the use and implementation of the package, and to provide some basic related information. This may be important for some users as a means to ensure compliancy with any legal requirements that may exist in the countries that they operate in, and some users may need to adjust their website policies in accordance with this information.

First and foremost, please realise that I (the package author) am not a lawyer, nor a qualified legal professional of any kind. Therefore, I am not legally qualified to provide legal advice. Also, in some cases, exact legal requirements may vary between different countries and jurisdictions, and these varying legal requirements may sometimes conflict (such as, for example, in the case of countries that favour privacy rights and the right to be forgotten, versus countries that favour extended data retention). Consider also that access to the package is not restricted to specific countries or jurisdictions, and therefore, the package userbase is likely to the geographically diverse. These points considered, I'm not in a position to state what it means to be "legally compliant" for all users, in all regards. However, I hope that the information herein will help you to come to a decision yourself regarding what you must do in order to remain legally compliant in the context of the package. If you have any doubts or concerns regarding the information herein, or if you need additional help and advice from a legal perspective, I would recommend consulting a qualified legal professional.

#### 11.1 LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY

As per already stated by the package license, the package is provided without any warranty. This includes (but is not limited to) all scope of liability. The package is provided to you for your convenience, in the hope that it will be useful, and that it will provide some benefit for you. However, whether you use or implement the package, is your own choice. You are not forced to use or implement the package, but when you do so, you are responsible for that decision. Neither I, nor any other contributors to the package, are legally responsible for the consequences of the decisions that you make, regardless of whether direct, indirect, implied, or otherwise.

#### 11.2 THIRD PARTIES

Depending on its exact configuration and implementation, the package may communicate and share information with third parties in some cases. This information may be defined as "personally identifiable information" (PII) in some contexts, by some jurisdictions.

How this information may be used by these third parties, is subject to the various policies set forth by these third parties, and is outside the scope of this documentation. However, in all such cases, sharing of information with these third parties can be disabled. In all such cases, if you choose to enable it, it is your responsibility to research any concerns that you may have regarding the privacy, security, and usage of PII by these third parties. If any doubts exist, or if you're unsatisfied with the conduct of these third parties in regards to PII, it may be best to disable all sharing of information with these third parties.

For the purpose of transparency, the type of information shared, and with whom, is described below.

##### 11.2.0 HOSTNAME LOOKUP

If you use any features or modules intended to work with hostnames (such as the "bad hosts blocker module", "tor project exit nodes block module", or "search engine verification", for example), CIDRAM needs to be able to obtain the hostname of inbound requests somehow. Typically, it does this by requesting the hostname of the IP address of inbound requests from a DNS server, or by requesting the information through functionality provided by the system where CIDRAM is installed (this is typically referred to as a "hostname lookup"). The DNS servers defined by default belong to the Google DNS service (but this can be easily changed via configuration). The exact services communicated with is configurable, and depends on how you configure the package. In the case of using functionality provided by the system where CIDRAM is installed, you'll need to contact your system administrator to determine which routes hostname lookups use. Hostname lookups can be prevented in CIDRAM by avoiding the affected modules or by modifying the package configuration in accordance with your needs.

*Relevant configuration directives:*
- `general` -> `default_dns`
- `general` -> `search_engine_verification`
- `general` -> `force_hostname_lookup`
- `general` -> `allow_gethostbyaddr_lookup`

##### 11.2.1 WEBFONTS

Some custom themes, as well as the the standard UI ("user interface") for the CIDRAM front-end and the "Access Denied" page, may use webfonts for aesthetic reasons. Webfonts are disabled by default, but when enabled, direct communication between the user's browser and the service hosting the webfonts occurs. This may potentially involve communicating information such as the user's IP address, user agent, operating system, and other details available to the request. Most of these webfonts are hosted by the Google Fonts service.

*Relevant configuration directives:*
- `general` -> `disable_webfonts`

##### 11.2.2 SEARCH ENGINE VERIFICATION

When search engine verification is enabled, CIDRAM attempts to perform "forward DNS lookups" to verify whether requests claiming to originate from search engines are authentic. To do this, it uses the Google DNS service to attempt to resolve IP addresses from the hostnames of these inbound requests (in this process, the hostnames of these inbound requests is shared with the service).

*Relevant configuration directives:*
- `general` -> `search_engine_verification`

##### 11.2.3 GOOGLE reCAPTCHA

CIDRAM optionally supports Google reCAPTCHA, providing a means for users to bypass the "Access Denied" page by completing a reCAPTCHA instance (more information about this feature is described earlier in the documentation, most notably in the configuration section). Google reCAPTCHA requires API keys in order to be work correctly, and is thereby disabled by default. It can be enabled by defining the required API keys in the package configuration. When enabled, direct communication between the user's browser and the reCAPTCHA service occurs. This may potentially involve communicating information such as the user's IP address, user agent, operating system, and other details available to the request. The user's IP address may also be shared in communication between CIDRAM and the reCAPTCHA service when verifying the validity of a reCAPTCHA instance and verifying whether it was completed successfully.

*Relevant configuration directives: Anything listed under the "recaptcha" configuration category.*

##### 11.2.4 STOP FORUM SPAM

[Stop Forum Spam](https://www.stopforumspam.com/) is a fantastic, freely available service that can help to protect forums, blogs, and websites from spammers. It does this by providing a database of known spammers, and an API that can be leveraged to check whether an IP address, username, or email address is listed on its database.

CIDRAM provides an optional module that leverages this API to check whether the IP address of inbound requests belongs to a suspected spammer. The module is not installed by default, but if you choose to install it, user IP addresses may be shared with the Stop Forum Spam API in accordance with the intended purpose of the module. When the module is installed, CIDRAM communicates with this API whenever an inbound request requests a resource that CIDRAM recognises as a type of resource frequently targeted by spammers (such as login pages, registration pages, email verification pages, comment forms, etc).

#### 11.3 LOGGING

Logging is an important part of CIDRAM for a number of reasons. It may be difficult to diagnose and resolve false positives when the block events that cause them aren't logged. Without logging block events, it may be difficult to ascertain exactly how performant CIDRAM is in any particular context, and it may be difficult to determine where its shortfalls may be, and what changes may be required to its configuration or signatures accordingly, in order for it to continue functioning as intended. Regardless, logging mightn't be desirable for all users, and remains entirely optional. In CIDRAM, logging is disabled by default. To enable it, CIDRAM must be configured accordingly.

Additionally, whether logging is legally permissible, and to the extent that it is legally permissible (e.g., the types of information that may logged, for how long, and under what circumstances), may vary, depending on jurisdiction and on the context where CIDRAM is implemented (e.g., whether you're operating as an individual, as a corporate entity, and whether on a commercial or non-commercial basis). It may therefore be useful for you to read through this section carefully.

There are multiple types of logging that CIDRAM can perform. Different types of logging involves different types of information, for different reasons.

##### 11.3.0 BLOCK EVENTS

The primary type of logging that CIDRAM can perform relates to "block events". This type of logging relates to when CIDRAM blocks a request, and can be provided in three different formats:
- Human readable logfiles.
- Apache-style logfiles.
- Serialised logfiles.

A block event, logged to a human readable logfile, typically looks something like this (as an example):

```
ID: 1234
Script Version: CIDRAM v1.6.0
Date/Time: Day, dd Mon 20xx hh:ii:ss +0000
IP Address: x.x.x.x
Hostname: dns.hostname.tld
Signatures Count: 1
Signatures Reference: x.x.x.x/xx
Why Blocked: Cloud service ("Network Name", Lxx:Fx, [XX])!
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/66.0.3359.181 Safari/537.36
Reconstructed URI: http://your-site.tld/index.php
reCAPTCHA State: Enabled.
```

That same block event, logged to an Apache-style logfile, would look something like this:

```
x.x.x.x - - [Day, dd Mon 20xx hh:ii:ss +0000] "GET /index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 xxxx "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/66.0.3359.181 Safari/537.36"
```

A logged block event typically includes the following information:
- An ID number referencing the block event.
- The version of CIDRAM currently in use.
- The date and time that the block event occurred.
- The IP address of the blocked request.
- The hostname of the IP address of the blocked request (when available).
- The number of signatures triggered by the request.
- References to the signatures triggered.
- References to the reasons for the block event and some basic, related debug information.
- The user agent of the blocked request (i.e., how the requesting entity identified itself to the request).
- A reconstruction of the identifier for the resource originally requested.
- The reCAPTCHA state for the current request (when relevant).

The configuration directives responsible for this type of logging, and for each of the three formats available, are:
- `general` -> `logfile`
- `general` -> `logfileApache`
- `general` -> `logfileSerialized`

When these directives are left empty, this type of logging will remain disabled.

##### 11.3.1 reCAPTCHA LOGGING

This type of logging relates specifically to reCAPTCHA instances, and occurs only when a user attempts to complete a reCAPTCHA instance.

A reCAPTCHA log entry contains the IP address of the user attempting to complete a reCAPTCHA instance, the date and time that the attempt occurred, and the reCAPTCHA state. A reCAPTCHA log entry typically looks something like this (as an example):

```
IP Address: x.x.x.x - Date/Time: Day, dd Mon 20xx hh:ii:ss +0000 - reCAPTCHA State: Passed!
```

The configuration directive responsible for reCAPTCHA logging is:
- `recaptcha` -> `logfile`

##### 11.3.2 FRONT-END LOGGING

This type of logging relates front-end login attempts, and occurs only when a user attempts to log into the front-end (assuming front-end access is enabled).

A front-end log entry contains the IP address of the user attempting to log in, the date and time that the attempt occurred, and the results of the attempt (successfully logged in, or failed to log in). A front-end log entry typically looks something like this (as an example):

```
x.x.x.x - Day, dd Mon 20xx hh:ii:ss +0000 - "admin" - Logged in.
```

The configuration directive responsible for front-end logging is:
- `general` -> `FrontEndLog`

##### 11.3.3 LOG ROTATION

You may want to purge logs after a period of time, or may be required to do so by law (i.e., the amount of time that it's legally permissible for you to retain logs may be limited by law). You can achieve this by including date/time markers in the names of your logfiles as per specified by your package configuration (e.g., `{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}.log`), and then enabling log rotation (log rotation allows you to perform some action on logfiles when specified limits are exceeded).

For example: If I was legally required to delete logs after 30 days, I could specify `{dd}.log` in the names of my logfiles (`{dd}` represents days), set the value of `log_rotation_limit` to 30, and set the value of `log_rotation_action` to `Delete`.

Conversely, if you're required to retain logs for an extended period of time, you could either not use log rotation at all, or you could set the value of `log_rotation_action` to `Archive`, to compress logfiles, thereby reducing the total amount of disk space that they occupy.

*Relevant configuration directives:*
- `general` -> `log_rotation_limit`
- `general` -> `log_rotation_action`

##### 11.3.4 LOG TRUNCATION

It's also possible to truncate individual logfiles when they exceed a certain size, if this is something you might need or want to do.

*Relevant configuration directives:*
- `general` -> `truncate`

##### 11.3.5 IP ADDRESS PSEUDONYMISATION

Firstly, if you're not familiar with the term "pseudonymisation", the following resources can help explain it in some detail:
- [[trust-hub.com] What is pseudonymisation?](https://www.trust-hub.com/news/what-is-pseudonymisation/)
- [[Wikipedia] Pseudonymization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization)

In some circumstances, you may be legally required to anonymise or pseudonymise any PII collected, processed, or stored. Although this concept has existed for quite some time now, GDPR/DSGVO notably mentions, and specifically encourages "pseudonymisation".

CIDRAM is able to pseudonymise IP addresses when logging them, if this is something you might need or want to do. When CIDRAM pseudonymises IP addresses, when logged, the final octet of IPv4 addresses, and everything after the second part of IPv6 addresses is represented by an "x" (effectively rounding IPv4 addresses to the initial address of the 24th subnet they factor into, and IPv6 addresses to the initial address of the 32nd subnet they factor into).

*Note: CIDRAM's IP address pseudonymisation process doesn't affect CIDRAM's IP tracking feature. If this is a problem for you, it may be best to disable IP tracking entirely. This can be achieved by setting `track_mode` to `false` and by avoiding any modules.*

*Relevant configuration directives:*
- `signatures` -> `track_mode`
- `legal` -> `pseudonymise_ip_addresses`

##### 11.3.6 OMITTING LOG INFORMATION

If you want to take it a step further by preventing specific types of information from being logged entirely, this is also possible to do. CIDRAM provides configuration directives to control whether IP addresses, hostnames, and user agents are included in logs. By default, all three of these data points are included in logs when available. Setting any of these configuration directives to `true` will omit the corresponding information from logs.

*Note: There's no reason to pseudonymise IP addresses when omitting them from logs entirely.*

*Relevant configuration directives:*
- `legal` -> `omit_ip`
- `legal` -> `omit_hostname`
- `legal` -> `omit_ua`

##### 11.3.7 STATISTICS

CIDRAM is optionally able to track statistics such as the total number of block events or reCAPTCHA instances that have occurred since some particular point in time. This feature is disabled by default, but can be enabled via the package configuration. This feature only tracks the total number of events occurred, and doesn't include any information about specific events (and therefore, shouldn't be regarded as PII).

*Relevant configuration directives:*
- `general` -> `statistics`

##### 11.3.8 ENCRYPTION

CIDRAM doesn't encrypt its cache or any log information. Cache and log encryption may be introduced in the future, but there aren't any specific plans for it currently. If you're concerned about unauthorised third parties gaining access to parts of CIDRAM that may contain PII or sensitive information such as its cache or logs, I would recommend that CIDRAM not be installed at a publicly accessible location (e.g., install CIDRAM outside the standard `public_html` directory or equivalent thereof available to most standard webservers) and that appropriately restrictive permissions be enforced for the directory where it resides (in particular, for the vault directory). If that isn't sufficient to address your concerns, then configure CIDRAM as such that the types of information causing your concerns won't be collected or logged in the first place (such as, by disabling logging).

#### 11.4 COOKIES

CIDRAM sets cookies at two points in its codebase. Firstly, when a user successfully completes a reCAPTCHA instance (and assuming that `lockuser` is set to `true`), CIDRAM sets a cookie in order to be able to remember for subsequent requests that the user has already completed a reCAPTCHA instance, so that it won't need to continuously ask the user to complete a reCAPTCHA instance on subsequent requests. Secondly, when a user successfully logs into the front-end, CIDRAM sets a cookie in order to be able to remember the user for subsequent requests (i.e., cookies are used for authenticate the user to a login session).

In both cases, cookie warnings are displayed prominently (when applicable), warning the user that cookies will be set if they engage in the relevant actions. Cookies aren't set at any other points in the codebase.

*Note: CIDRAM's particular implementation of the "invisible" API for reCAPTCHA might be incompatible with cookie laws in some jurisdictions, and should be avoided by any websites subject to such laws. Opting to use the "V2" API instead, or simply disabling reCAPTCHA entirely, may be preferable.*

*Relevant configuration directives:*
- `general` -> `disable_frontend`
- `recaptcha` -> `lockuser`
- `recaptcha` -> `api`

#### 11.5 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING

CIDRAM doesn't collect or process any information for marketing or advertising purposes, and neither sells nor profits from any collected or logged information. CIDRAM is not a commercial enterprise, nor is related to any commercial interests, so doing these things wouldn't make any sense. This has been the case since the beginning of the project, and continues to be the case today. Additionally, doing these things would be counter-productive to the spirit and intended purpose of the project as a whole, and for as long as I continue to maintain the project, will never happen.

#### 11.6 PRIVACY POLICY

In some circumstances, you may be legally required to clearly display a link to your privacy policy on all pages and sections of your website. This may be important as a means to ensure that users and well-informed of your exact privacy practices, the types of PII you collect, and how you intend to use it. In order to be able to include such a link on CIDRAM's "Access Denied" page, a configuration directive is provided to specify the URL to your privacy policy.

*Note: It's strongly recommended that your privacy policy page isn't placed behind CIDRAM's protection. If CIDRAM protects your privacy policy page, and a user blocked by CIDRAM clicks the link to your privacy policy, they'll just be blocked again, and won't be able to see your privacy policy. Ideally, you should link to a static copy of your privacy policy, such as an HTML page or plain-text file which isn't protected by CIDRAM.*

*Relevant configuration directives:*
- `legal` -> `privacy_policy`

#### 11.7 GDPR/DSGVO

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation of the European Union, which comes into effect as of May 25, 2018. The primary goal of the regulation is to give control to EU citizens and residents regarding their own personal data, and to unify regulation within the EU concerning privacy and personal data.

The regulation contains specific provisions pertaining to the processing of "personally identifiable information" (PII) of any "data subjects" (any identified or identifiable natural person) either from or within the EU. To be compliant with the regulation, "enterprises" (as per defined by the regulation), and any relevant systems and processes must implement "privacy by design" by default, must use the highest possible privacy settings, must implement necessary safeguards for any stored or processed information (including, but not limited to, the implementation of pseudonymisation or full anonymisation of data), must clearly and unambiguously declare the types of data they collect, how they process it, for what reasons, for how long they retain it, and whether they share this data with any third parties, the types of data shared with third parties, how, why, and so on.

Data may not be processed unless there's a lawful basis for doing so, as per defined by the regulation. Generally, this means that in order to process a data subject's data on a lawful basis, it must be done in compliance with legal obligations, or done only after explicit, well-informed, unambiguous consent has been obtained from the data subject.

Because aspects of the regulation may evolve in time, in order to avoid the propagation of outdated information, it may be better to learn about the regulation from an authoritative source, as opposed to simply including the relevant information here in the package documentation (which may eventually become outdated as the regulation evolves).

[EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/) (a part of the official website of the European Union that provides information about EU law) provides extensive information about GDPR/DSGVO, available in 24 different languages (at the time of writing this), and available for download in PDF format. I would definitely recommend reading the information that they provide, in order to learn more about GDPR/DSGVO:
- [REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32016R0679)

[Intersoft Consulting](https://www.intersoft-consulting.de/) also provides extensive information about GDPR/DSGVO, available in German and English, which could be useful to learn more about GDPR/DSGVO:
- [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) – Final text neatly arranged](https://gdpr-info.eu/)

Alternatively, there's a brief (non-authoritative) overview of GDPR/DSGVO available at Wikipedia:
