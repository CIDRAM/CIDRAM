# Ignores file.


# ---
# If you want CIDRAM to completely ignore some specific sections within any of the signature files, you can use the
# "ignore.dat" file to specify which sections to ignore. On a new line, write "Ignore", followed by a space, followed
# by the name of the section that you want CIDRAM to ignore (anything else in this file won't have any affect on
# CIDRAM and can be treated in the same manner as comments, documentation markup, etc).

# The list below is included here as an example; The sections listed here are the names of some arbitrarily chosen
# sections from the default CIDRAM signature files, listed here to demonstrate what an ignore list could look like.
# These examples are commmented out at this time (because they're intended only as examples and nothing more).

# Ignore CH-NET S.R.L
# Ignore Hurricane Electric
# Ignore Internap Network
# Ignore proXPN Direct LLC

# The entries below correspond to signature sections in the signature files that are considered to have a high
# probability of generating false positives. Most of these entries are demographically/regionally dependant, and are
# included here by default as to help ensure that CIDRAM will be usable by people from various different demographics,
# regions, etc. If you feel that you don't need them (e.g., if they don't correspond to a demographic/region that needs
# to be served from your website), as a means to maximise the benefit that CIDRAM can provide for you, you should
# either comment them out or remove them from this file entirely. Alternatively, if you're happy to accept the idea of
# requesting that any users connecting from IPs blocked by these sections complete an instance of reCAPTCHA in order to
# gain access to your website, you could enable CIDRAM's reCAPTCHA feature and remove these entries anyhow, in order to
# allows these users a means of accessing your website while simultaneously maximising the benefit that CIDRAM can
# provide for you (to the extent of being able to block undesirable non-human traffic, at least).
