; When using the front-end logs page to view log data, CIDRAM sanitises the log
; data before displaying it, to protect users from XSS attacks and other
; potential threats that log data could contain. However, by default, data
; isn't sanitised during logging. This is to ensure that log data is preserved
; accurately, to aid any heuristic or forensic analysis that might be necessary
; in the future. However, in the event that a user attempts to read log data
; using external tools, and if those external tools don't perform their own
; sanitisation process, the user could be exposed to XSS attacks. If necessary,
; you can change the default behaviour using this configuration directive. True
; = Sanitise data when logging it (data is preserved less accurately, but XSS
; risk is lower). False = Don't sanitise data when logging it (data is
; preserved more accurately, but XSS risk is higher) [Default].
