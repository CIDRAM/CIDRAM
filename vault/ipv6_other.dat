# ASN 174 ("Cogent Communications").

# We've experienced a significant amount of unwanted traffic from their ASN in
# the past (hack attempts, spamming, scraping, etc), and this type of traffic
# should generally be blocked, but their ASN unfortunately encompasses and
# interlaces with a significant number of benign human endpoints, ISPs,
# backbone architecture, etc that we don't want to block, so I'm not outright
# listing the ASN in entirety. Listings have also been split across different
# signature files as to list at the signature files where best suited.
