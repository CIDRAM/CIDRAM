Extended Description Chart.js: "Enables the front-end to generate doughnut charts.<br />{{Links.Chart.js}} is available via the {{Links.MIT}} license."
Extended Description PHPMailer: "Required for using any functionality that involves sending email.<br />{{Links.PHPMailer.PHPMailer}} is available via the {{Links.PHPMailer.License}} license."
config_abuseipdb_report_back: "Allow CIDRAM to report detected bad behavior back to AbuseIPDB using your API key? Default = False."
config_bobuam_block_bots: "Block bots recognized as malicious or unwanted?"
config_components: "Configuration for the activation and the deactivation of the components used by CIDRAM. Typically populated by the updates page, but can also be managed from here for finer control and for custom components not recognized by the updates page."
config_extras_signatures: "Which types of signatures should be honored?"
config_frontend_custom_header: "Inserted as HTML at the very beginning of all front-end pages. This could be useful in case you want to include a website logo, personalized header, scripts, or similar at all such pages."
config_general_lang_override: "Localize according to HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE whenever possible? True = Yes [Default]; False = No."
config_legal_pseudonymise_ip_addresses: "Pseudonymize IP addresses when logging? True = Yes [Default]; False = No."
config_logging_log_sanitisation: "When using the front-end logs page to view log data, CIDRAM sanitizes the log data before displaying it, to protect users from XSS attacks and other potential threats that log data could contain. However, by default, data isn't sanitised during logging. This is to ensure that log data is preserved accurately, to aid any heuristic or forensic analysis that might be necessary in the future. However, in the event that a user attempts to read log data using external tools, and if those external tools don't perform their own sanitisation process, the user could be exposed to XSS attacks. If necessary, you can change the default behavior using this configuration directive. True = Sanitise data when logging it (data is preserved less accurately, but XSS risk is lower). False = Don't sanitise data when logging it (data is preserved more accurately, but XSS risk is higher) [Default]."
config_logging_serialised_log: "Serialized file for logging all blocked access attempts. Specify a filename, or leave blank to disable."
config_signatures_shorthand: "Controls for what to do with a request when there's a positive match against a signature which utilizes the given shorthand words."
config_template_data_custom_header: "Inserted as HTML at the very beginning of all "access denied" pages. This could be useful in case you want to include a website logo, personalized header, scripts, or similar at all such pages."
hints_client_honour: "No matter how we instruct the client, it's important to remember that we ultimately have no control over what the client chooses to do, and there's zero guarantee that the client will honor our instructions."
hints_shorthand:
 0.: "If your website needs access via LAN or localhost, don't block this. Otherwise though, you can block this."
 1.: "None of the default signature files use this, but it's supported nonetheless in case it might be useful for some users."
 2.: "If you need users to be able to access your website via proxies, don't block this. Otherwise though, you can block this."
 3.: "Direct usage in signatures isn't supported, but it may be invoked by other means in particular circumstances."
 4.: "Refers to cases where shorthand words aren't used at all, or aren't recognized by CIDRAM."
 One per signature.: "A signature may invoke multiple profiles, but can use only one shorthand word. It's possible that multiple shorthand words may be suitable, but as only one can be used, we aim to always use only the most suitable."
 Priority.: "An option selected always takes priority over an option not selected. E.g., if multiple shorthand words are in play but only one of them is set as being blocked, the request will still be blocked."
 Human endpoints and cloud services.: "Cloud service may refer to webhosting providers, server farms, data centers, or any number of other things. Human endpoint refers to the means by which a human accesses the internet, such as by way of an internet service provider. A network usually provides just one or the other, but may sometimes provide both. We aim to never identify potential human endpoints as cloud services. Therefore, a cloud service may be identified as something else if its range is shared by known human endpoints. Conversely, we aim to always identify cloud services, whose ranges are not shared by any known human endpoints, as cloud services. Therefore, a request identified explicitly as a cloud service probably doesn't share its range with any known human endpoints. Likewise, a request identified explicitly by attacks or spam probably does. However, the internet is always in flux, the purposes of networks changes over time, and ranges are always being bought or sold, so remain cognisant and vigilant in regards to false positives."
hints_verification:
 "What are "positives" and "negatives"?": "When verifying the identity presented by a request, a successful outcome could be described as "positive" or "negative". In the case that the identity presented is confirmed to be the true identity, it would be described as "positive". In the case that the identity presented is confirmed to be falsified, it would be described as "negative". However, an unsuccessful outcome (e.g., verification fails, or the veracity of the identity presented isn't able to be determined) would not be described as "positive" or "negative". Instead, an unsuccessful outcome would be described simply as non-verified. When no attempt to verify the identity presented by a request is made, the request would likewise be described as non-verified. The terms make sense only in the context where the identity presented by a request is recognized, and therefore, where verification is possible. In cases where the identity presented doesn't match the options provided above, or where no identity is presented, the options provided above become irrelevant."
 "What are "single-hit bypasses"?": "In some cases, a positive-verified request may still blocked as a result of the signature files, modules, or other conditions of the request, and bypasses may be necessary in order to avoid false positives. In the case where a bypass is intended to deal with exactly one infraction, no more and no less, such a bypass could be described as a "single-hit bypass"."
