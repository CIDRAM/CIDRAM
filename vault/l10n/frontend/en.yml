 Plain English.: "Duration can be described by writing the units in plain English. E.g., <strong>1 week 2 days 3 hours 4 minutes 5 seconds</strong> for one week, two days, three hours, four minutes, five seconds."
 Constraints.: "Notation can be mixed, but units must always be described from largest to smallest, and can't be repeated. E.g., <strong>1 week 2 days 3′4″</strong> is <span class="txtGn">valid</span> and will be understood correctly, but <strong>3′4″ 1 week 2 days</strong> and <strong>3 hours 3h 3°</strong> are <span class="txtRd">invalid</span>. CIDRAM doesn't care whether you use spacing or not. Numbers must be plain and unformatted. For practicality, the largest supported unit is a week. When configuration is updated, CIDRAM normalises durations to arctime."

 Human endpoints and cloud services.:

Human endpoint refers to the means by which a human accesses the internet, such as by way of an internet service provider. A network usually provides just one or the other, but may sometimes provide both. We aim to never identify potential human endpoints as cloud services. Therefore, a cloud service may be identified as something else if its range is shared by known human endpoints. Conversely, we aim to always identify cloud services, whose ranges are not shared by any known human endpoints, as cloud services. Therefore, a request identified explicitly as a cloud service probably doesn't share its range with any known human endpoints. Likewise, a request identified explicitly by attacks or spam probably does. However, the internet is always in flux, the purposes of networks changes over time, and ranges are always being bought or sold, so remain cognisant and vigilant in regards to false positives."

hints_verification:
 "What are "positives" and "negatives"?":
  en-AU: "When verifying the identity presented by a request, a successful outcome could be described as "positive" or "negative". In the case that the identity presented is confirmed to be the true identity, it would be described as "positive". In the case that the identity presented is confirmed to be falsified, it would be described as "negative". However, an unsuccessful outcome (e.g., verification fails, or the veracity of the identity presented isn't able to be determined) would not be described as "positive" or "negative". Instead, an unsuccessful outcome would be described simply as non-verified. When no attempt to verify the identity presented by a request is made, the request would likewise be described as non-verified. The terms make sense only in the context where the identity presented by a request is recognised, and therefore, where verification is possible. In cases where the identity presented doesn't match the options provided above, or where no identity is presented, the options provided above become irrelevant."

 "What are "single-hit bypasses"?": "In some cases, a positive-verified request may still blocked as a result of the signature files, modules, or other conditions of the request, and bypasses may be necessary in order to avoid false positives. In the case where a bypass is intended to deal with exactly one infraction, no more and no less, such a bypass could be described as a "single-hit bypass"."
hints_want_to_block: "!! Most users will likely want this to be blocked, regardless of whether it's real or falsified. That can be achieved by having "attempt to verify" be not selected and "block non-verified requests" be selected. However, because some users may want to be able to verify such requests (in order to block negatives while allowing positives), instead of blocking such requests via modules, options for handling such requests are provided here."
info_cli_by_default_ips: |
 By default, IPs are tested against all signature files, all modules, all
 auxiliary rules, *and* against social media and search engine verification.
 --no-sig    Prevents testing against signature files.
 --no-mod    Prevents testing against modules.
 --no-sev    Prevents search engine verification.
 --no-smv    Prevents social media verification.
 --no-ov     Prevents other verification.
 --no-aux    Prevents testing against auxiliary rules.

 aggregates their content, then writes the aggregated data to output.dat):
info_cli_you_can_also_r: "You can also read from files like so:"
info_cli_you_can_also_u: |
 You can also use commas instead if you want (this is treated the same as using
 multilines, but you won't need to use quotes, and don't mix both together):
info_cli_you_can_also_w: "You can also write to files like so:"
info_cli_you_can_print_: |

  activate_modules: &MayImpactPerformance "Not generally recommended, as there's likely to be some that you don't need. Installing and activating components when they aren't needed could negatively impact performance."
  install_l10n_core: &RecommendKeepingCore "When the <code>lang_override</code> configuration directive is enabled, if a user's browser specifies a particular language preference, as long as core L10N data for that language is installed, CIDRAM is able to display the "access denied" page in that specified language. Accordingly, having all core L10N data remain installed is recommended."
  install_l10n_fe: &RecommendFEOnlyNeeded "Your preferred language can be specified via the <code>lang</code> configuration directive. Once this has been done, you're unlikely to need any front-end L10N data other than that for your preferred language, and may want to remove it for the sake of marginally freeing up some available disk space. Though, whether you choose to remove it or keep it, either way, shouldn't do any harm."
