# If you want CIDRAM to completely ignore some specific sections within any of
# the signature files, you can use the "ignore.dat" file to specify which
# sections to ignore. On a new line, write "Ignore", followed by a space,
# followed by the name of the section that you want CIDRAM to ignore (anything
# else in this file won't have any effect on CIDRAM and can be treated in the
# same manner as comments, documentation markup, etc).

# It's also possible to ignore some specific parts of specific sections, on the
# basis of the country of origin (i.e., to ignore those signatures within a
# specific signature section which originate from a specific country of
# origin), thus allowing further fine-tuning of how CIDRAM processes its
# signature files. To do this, add ":XX" after the name of the section, using
# the 3166-1 alpha-2 country code instead of XX (e.g., AU for Australia, US for
# the United States, CN for China, FR for France, etc).
